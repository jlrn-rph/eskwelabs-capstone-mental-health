"If I'm a bisexual woman, then should I not have friends at all because they could all be a threat to my relationship?",27,"I know that not every woman is bisexual or gay, but what about the ones that are? If I'm in a relationship, and the other person and I are compatible based on our sexual orientation, then I shouldn't be friends with them if we follow the logic of men-women friendships. Also, even if the other person is straight I'm still not, so in theory, anyone and everyone could be a threat if we go by the aforementioned logic. I have friends of all genders though without issues so I'm not really asking of course, just thinking about how stupid the ""men and women can never be friends"" argument is.

ETA: what I wanted to highlight here is that people seemingly trust men-women friendships less in general, even without personal trauma. Lots of people set a boundary like ""you can't have friends of the opposite gender"", but at the same time, you rarely hear about bisexuals not ""allowed"" to have friends of the same gender, when it's basically the same thing.

The greatest enemy to mankind is corporations,13,"The obesity epidemic is largely the fault of corporations who paid off Harvard scientists to lie about the dangers of fats, and push foods higher in carbs, which are cheaper to make, meaning larger profits.

Companies every day are putting preservatives in the foods we consume, that are killing us, purely to make more money.

Companies in America lobby politicians every day in order to remove life saving restrictions. Think Palestine, Ohio.

Radium. Leaded gasoline and paint. Asbestos. Microplastics. Cancer alley. All these things pushed by companies who were either fully aware of their dangers, or hugely negligent in ensuring they were safe.

Collectively I'd be surprised if corporations weren't responsible for billions of deaths.

I realized why I love to sleep,5,"Sleep is nice for many reasons, but the other week it hit me why sleep is the best thing in the world. It's not only because it leaves me somewhat well rested or that it's nice to dream. The reason to why sleep has become so crucial to me is far more depressing - it's an escape.

For most of my life, I've been afraid of getting into conflicts and always tried to accommodate co-workers, friends and so on to avoid frictions. This has obviously proven to be a futile effort since it only left me constantly stressed out.   
4-5 months ago, however, something fundamentally changed in my head, and the ""physical experience"" of it is hard to describe, but something definitely changed/broke inside me.  
Ever since, I can sense that people have noticed how I nowadays have a care free attitude, but it's not something that stems from personal growth, it comes from long time bitterness, exhaustion and almost feels like I surrender, give up - I quit. Things that usually annoyed me to the point of anger at my job or in my private life no longer do. It's like I've finally accepted that things and people are the way they are, and that I no longer have the strength to try to change people or wish that they will change. Instead, I've changed my position in relation to said people or things.

No longer being stressed out may sound wonderful, and it is, but apathy doesn't pick and choose, it takes it all. I seldomly feel anger, annoyance or other negative emotions, but I no longer feel sadness, joy or excitement either, and that's a problem.

This year, my mom has gotten a diagnosis for Parkinson's, my sister is going through a divorce (I was told about both the same week), I'm getting married in August and I feel... nothing.

Intellectually speaking, I'm know for a fact that the first two would devastate me and the third would leave me super excited, and somewhere, I know I am. I just don't feel it. It's a complete absence of any emotion, and always keeping up the facade to not seem like a complete asshole is exhausting in and of itself. 

I've been in therapy, but it's obviously not an universal solution to my problems.

To best describe where I'm at, I'll  leave y'all with an analogy: I'm a vehicle that has been looking for the right path for a long time, and after the extensive search for said path, the fuel has run out and there's nothing left in the tank.

Bro... Sex and genitals are so fucking weird.,207,"I just looked up different types of Vaginas for the first time and- Holy fucking shit.

Ok so for context. Im 19, I have NEVER watched porn in my life. Im serious when I say that. The only exposure I have ever had to porn was either through memes or accidental, and its always usually drawn stuff or diagrams. I'm asexually aromantic, So I've never been in a sexual nor romantic relationship with someone and im mentally incapable of developing such a thing.

So today I was curious what a *VULVA looks like cus im an artist and I wanted to try my hand at NSFW for money reasons (big bucks there.) And like- I looked up different types of IRL coochie and- holy shit... Its so WEIRD BRO- LIKE- I had no fucking clue. And then I was thinkin like... People jerk off to this shit?!! Like Irl porn n shit, does it really look like that?! Dude im so fucking inexperienced with the idea of genitalia that it took me till I was 16 to realize that foreskin is a literally sheath over the penis. I thought it was just the TIP of the penis, like a mushroom, so when guys get circumsized, they cut off the tip of your ding-dong.

It was this small niche hobby that most people didn't even really understand, and I absolutely rocked at it. Nowadays, though, it's gotten all big and official, and now I feel like my work sucks and is trivial compared to what people do these days. I don't do crazy shit with EVA foam or whatever. I don't have a Playboy level body with a flat stomach, big tits, and cheeks that could cut glass. I'm just some schmuck, but I want to be good at this. I just want everyone else to not have soared ahead.

I'm an adult now with obligations and less time. I can't afford to get amazing now. I just don't have the resources to do it anymore. But I don't want to just hand off everything I care about being good at, to people who have the luxury of time to be amazing.

Same with tabletop games and roleplaying. It's now this gigantic thing instead of a nearly sacred small thing that my friends and I and no one else seemed to know about. It was Our Thing. Now it's big enough that it's other people's thing, too, and something I can be better or worse at than others.

It's wild how quickly we make major investments like vehicle and real estate purchases,23,"Think about it.

These are very expensive, long-term purchases that we're expected to adjudicate within ourselves in, relatively, short time.

My random thought of the day.,2,"There's a pretty big misconception about money and having a lot of it.  
  
Before you ever reach that level, you have to be able to handle it. Or you'll crash and burn with debt you can't do anything about.  
  
Most people think it's the answer to living the life they want, when in reality, the life you actually want is somewhere directly in front of you.  
  
But we consume too much bullshit. Which leads us to compare ourselves to youtubers and football players and actors and politicians and Esports competitors.  
  
And it perverts our minds from the truth.  
  
**Which is:** *You are where you are for a reason. The people in your life, are there for a reason.*  
  
The reason itself isn't as important as you figuring out how to make the absolute best out of the situation you're in. So that you can grow and graduate to the next situation.  
  
It's like leveling up in a video game.  
  
It is impossible to move on to level 2 before you complete level 1 (to some degree).  
  
The trick is, learning how to not let your past control your feelings, but using it as you move forward to know how to conduct yourself in the now. Like a show you've seen before to help you make a better choice this time around.  
  
And as far as the future goes lol....

Like the types of humor that I thought of as *good* still have their victims it's just either themselves or someone/something horrible that way you can still laugh as you aren't the victim and don't sympathize with the victim. 
  
 Slapstick for example is a person that is making mistakes  or getting ""hurt"". Aren't you glad that you're not that clumsy? Obviously they can't actually get hurt otherwise we would sympathize with them,  you have to be able to mock them for it to be funny. 
  
Absurdist humor shows how ""normal"" you are. Your boss walks on wearing a tutu is funny because of the comparison.
  
Impressions showcase others abnormal mannerisms and ways of speech.
  
Situational humor showcases how great you are Pat yourself on the back cause damn those world leaders, parents bus drivers airhosts, and bar keepers are corrupt, dumb or abnormal. 
  
All of it is making fun *of someone*",13wjugt,rachelcp,1685533306.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/13wjugt/humor_is_always_mean/,,Randomthoughts

  I've always just been people's sounding board. Just an ear, never a voice. It's no way to live. You end up resenting and disliking people even when people haven't done anything to intentionally hurt you. I know why I'm this way. It's the way my family conditioned me to be. They needed space to express themselves because they don't have that in their lives. They let other people use them to vent to.

The thing I love about Clinical Depression,353,"…is that no matter how many times you say it, people can’t seem to grasp that even when being properly treated and medicated, IT DOESN’T NEED A REASON. Sometimes, it just randomly slithers into the back of your brain, starts whispering, and shuts you down. Stop asking why. We likely don’t even know. Just be there. Be within reach. Be supportive, even in silence. Please. Sometimes we just gotta ride that shit out and we simply need someone close by to ride it out with us. 



This does not mean I think we should allow people to isolate or let depression go untreated. It just means that it’s a brain chemistry problem, not necessarily a situational problem. You’re not gonna fix it with a couple episodes of The Simpsons or a burger at Red Robin.

Toilet bowl handles and air freshener,1,"One day recently I had a realization of how dirty and germy toilet bowl flush handles and air fresheners are. I mean, I’ve always used my foot or toilet paper when flushing in public restrooms, but now i get creeped out even in my own home. On top of that, the thought of people going #2 and then using the air freshener before washing their hands really freaks me out. And the sink handles because we touch those before cleaning our hands, and then touching them after just reintroduces the bacteria.

Mascara is chapstick for your eyes?,3,"My guy friend recently told a friend I introduced him to that she’s pretty without makeup because she was talking about how she feels insecure without makeup on. Her and I both looked at him and looked at each other and at the same time we told him that he’s never seen her without makeup (it was the second time he’d ever met her). He responded with “wait really? What makeup do you wear?” I told him that normally she usually just wears mascara to which he replied “oh I don’t consider mascara makeup. That’s like chapstick for your eyes”. 

What does he mean. I’m so lost. Chapstick moisturizes your lips. Mascara doesn’t moisturize your eyes. Does he mean it’s a basic thing most people who wear makeup wear? Does he mean it’s something casual? Like it’s normal? It’s so normal that he doesn’t even consider it makeup he just considers it basic? Like a basic routine? It felt nice to hear him say that because I only wear mascara but (no offense) most guys don’t know anything about makeup and some will still compare girls to with or without makeup when they’re only wearing mascara. It’s demeaning. Mascara doesn’t change how your face is. They’re your real eyelashes it just makes them darker. Which isn’t what chapstick does. Did he mean lipstick? Tinted chapstick? Lipgloss? I’m so confused.

I would take physical disability over mental illness given the choice,534,"Personal issues aside, I often reflect on a story my grandmother once told me. She said one night someone called her and they just breathed into the phone. Rather than hang up she tried to coax them out, saying the general hellos, before eventually she started talking about her day, (she was a pretty wacky person). 

Eventually the person finally responded and explained that they had schizophrenia. They would sometimes become aware as they were calling random people. They exchanged pleasantries and that was it. The person would randomly call my grandma for maybe 5 years straight. She'd explain what was happening and the person would respond, apologize and tell her about their day. Sometimes they'd remember and sometimes not. 

There's no real end to this story the person stopped calling over time. I think movies sort of romanticize mental illness as something you can ""beat"" or overcome to some theatrical victory, but more often than not it's like an incurable cist or a tumor. It's something you are privileged to fight until you die.

Speaking of random thoughts...,1,"I've noticed that I often have a thought in an instant, all at once, and it can be as complicated or as simple as can be, but no matter what, I have to actually examine it and ""unravel"" it to fully be aware of it. Once I get to the end, I realize I already knew everything it contained from the moment of its inception, but... not conciously?

Like, if I hadn't taken the time to walk through it, it would have popped into my mind, and then faded into the background just as fast. Once I do walk through it, I have full, present, lucid awareness of it in a way I wouldn't have before.

I guess it's just hard to understand how all the information can all be there, seemingly instantly, yet I have to take time to understand it, despite being the one who made it. A thought that might take several minutes to articulate, even to myself, can be had in what feels like an instant, beginning-to-end, all at once, like a single point of condensed information.

I wonder how many things I think in a day, of varying complexities and depths, that I'm not actually aware of?

I never understood how ""young"" was 35, when 40 should be the real middle-age, since it's half the average of 80.

My dad died young at 53, so that's weird. Just 13 years from my current age, my dad died when I was a teenager. I really like how the younger generations are health focused.

Walking is such an underrated way to lose weight,96,"I had some friends that had weight issues, and they would try to combat it with inconsistent 20 minute runs that they would skip half the days because they got too lazy. The thing is, if you asked them if they wanted to do a one hour walk, they would call it a waste of time because ""it's just walking"" All of my other friends agreed with them and would call me weird for saying that vigorous exercise is not the only way to lose weight. When they did walk, they did it really consistently, and would burn probably just as many calories in the long run. Although it feels easy, walking is very underrated as a form of weight loss.  


EDIT: Obviously you cannot have any meaningful weight loss through exercise alone, but consistent exercise might make it slightly easier, allowing you to take in maybe an extra 200-300 calories per day depending on how much you do it.

I have a dumb idea for a D&D structure. The Laundrobath!,1,"Tired of needing several rooms in your Guild Hall just for bathtubs and wash tubs to wash your stinky guild members and yucky clothes? Well have I got the room for you!

Our piercing detergents are gentle on fabric, steel, leather, skin, flesh, visera, whathave you, but are ruthless on filth and grime from everyday adventuring!

Did one of your party fall in the dross of the sewers and now reeks of unwashed latrines? Have them go though a quick run of the Laundrobath and them and their outfit will be clean enough to gain +1 charisma temporarily!

Warrior have some acidic residue of that Gelatinous Cube slowly eating away at their chainmail? Ranger have flammable oil stains? Barbarian covered in blood? Wha-Bam?! Sla-Gam! Neutrealized and cleaned! And look! It even took off the surface rust off of the chainmail!

And to those with sensitive skin or open flesh wounds, don't you worry! Our flexible bristles are tough enough to scrape off the toughest stains, but so gentle on the body you'll feel like the filth is being massaged off. No constitution checks needed!

Order now and well teleport our local Goblin Artificer crew to install it within 6 hours or it's 10% off! Laundrobath room size may vary to fit comfortably within guild hall. 2 weeks supply of soaps and detergents included. . Do not attempt to mix healing or regeneration potions with the detergent, as it has been known to cause unnatural growths. Do not mix any chemicals with the included soaps and detergents, as irritation of the skin may occur. If irritation of skin occurs anyway, please consult Garrett Bros.

My mortgage went up 800 bucks since last month…,6,"We bought our house in 2015 and have a fixed mortgage that started out at 1200.00 (includes our hoa, taxes, home insurance etc). It has gone from 1200/mo to 3307.48/mo In just the last 3 years alone. I can’t even begin to describe how stressed out and upset I am. Thankfully I’ve already contacted my lender and county tax appraisal to challenge them but good god, why can’t people understand what the hell is happening in our country but especially in Texas. Our house was 200,000 when we bought and it’s now being valued at almost a million. It’s not even worth anything even remotely near that. When I tell you that home after home after home is going up for sale in my huge neighborhood I mean that I have never seen anything like it. Maybe a few sold when prices sky rocketed but not many. 

As of two months ago I have counted over 30 houses that have been put on the market for no more than 350k. Why would they now and not when the houses were selling for 5-600k in our hood? Well that’s because they didn’t want to sell, but due to the property taxes skyrocketing they now are forced to.

Always.,1,"I write this post as a reminder that not all things are bad.  
Relationships always evolve and so will you.

One day you'll wake up and just know things aren't alright. That's okay, you're learning something about yourself. As a child, learning to walk feels an eternity and you quickly forget it.

I have found that life is as fluid as you are willing to swim. 

Sometime in a point in your life everyone you care about will die. It's not a happy thought but as you grow it's one point you cannot avoid. Your finite time becomes real and it hurts.

This might seem obvious to the reader, but what I'm really trying to say is that it's important that we care now so future us's aren't saddled with the burden of how to find harmony. To love and be happy is all of our goals. 

I used to write all the time about how it is a shame that we can be so beautiful. I'm realizing now that the pen is starting to die and I sincerely wish the best for you in your life. We really can be beautiful and I hope that at the end of my life I get to see that in all of you. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.

Blackmail doesn't scare me,6,"So, I got this email(yes, I know it's probably not real  and a scam): 


>Hello

I know your password!

I infected you with a malware (RAT)/(Remote Administration Tool), some time ago and since then, I have been observing your actions. The malware gave me full access and control over your system, meaning, I can see everything on your screen, turn on your camera or microphone and you won't even notice about it, yes such things exist, you can Google it!
I have also access to all your contacts, I collected everything private from you, pictures, videos, everything!

And I MADE A VIDEO SHOWING BOTH YOU (through your webcam) AND THE VIDEO YOU WERE WATCHING (on the screen) WHILE SATISFYING YOURSELF!

I can send this video to all your contacts (email, social network) and publish all your private stuff everywhere!

You can prevent me from doing this!
To stop me, transfer exactly: 400$ with the current bitcoin (BTC) price to my bitcoin address.

If you don't know how to get bitcoin, Google - ""How to buy Bitcoin"", it's very simple for example with credit card. The wallet you can create here: https://www.blockchain.com

My bitcoin address is: 1D9E953D6A38pH6EhnjzZXJVHXfEu13iCF

Copy and paste my address - it's (CASE-sensitive).

You know this all isn't a joke, you got the proof above!
I think it's a very good price compared to the damage and hell it can bring into your life!

After receiving the payment, I will delete everything about you and you can live your life in peace like before. I give you 3 days to get the bitcoins!
Don't share this email with anyone, this should stay our little secret! <



I'm gonna be honest here. It just doesn't scare me. Maybe cause I'm older and don't care so much about peers or something. Family knowing? My mom would probably scold me, but that's probably about it. I'm an adult now, and if someone's got me jerking off, bless them cause I'm coming for that money. Getting that bag. Lol. But emotional distress? Nah. I can pretend emotional distress. I mean, pretty sure the government or whoever owns these phones already watching us. 

Then there is the whole know my passwords and stuff. Like yeah, that might make me a little irritated, but I'm gonna find you some way or the other to get you for identity theft and crap. 

I just don't understand blackmail though. Unless they've got something real dark on you. But my naked body jerking off? OK? I ain't sending you money. I'm not gonna send you more pics. Like you aren't getting a thing from me. I know some people, especially young people, feel violated by this and want it to be kept under wraps. But no body is going to control me. And I feel like I want to tell other girls the same. No body controls you. Same for dudes too. I'm sure some dudes have been blackmailed as well with this stuff. And the people blackmailing you can go down for alot worse. Especially if you are a minor. You got the power here. Realize that.

This will freak you out,7,"


Have you ever had a dream that you had to share because it scared you so bad. You need comfort from others or you wish you could share it so that the pain and fright can be shared. 



The problem with me sharing the content of the dream is that the people I have told have gotten into major accidents. They did not die but they said that when they thought about the dream, they would get distracted, get terrified and it would lead to an accident. 

As described by them, they would pander on the thought of the dream. The thinking of it  leads to deeper investigation and they become terrified about it. They cannot understand it, but what is worse is that when they imagine themselves dreaming such a dream they get scared and even some tremble with fright. 



But this gets freakier. I began to notice how the people who I don’t know but those that know my sibling or mother got into freak accidents as well…..(Do you see where this is going). When I asked my siblings and mother about how their friends are doing, again they did not die, but were hurt. I tried to keep asking questions, but each were hesitantly avoiding the questions. So, I thought maybe if they say, it might hurt, which is exactly what I did to protect my family from getting hurt.  


So, when I jokingly said, “ohhh did you tell them a bad dream.” Literally they were shaking with fright. They told me yes and that is when we began to explain how we all shared the same dream… FUCK were we frightened. Some paranormal shit that we encountered. But, I was happy that we shared that frightening dream. 



It seems that we share it, but we are immune to the accidents. Must be a family thing, Maybe… But the fact that we share the same dream. Same description, and same everything. When we say the dream to others, they get hurt.

What was the smallest thing that caused you to fall in love/get a crush on someone?,8,"I'll go first,

I was on a school trip my sophomore year with my theatre troupe, there was maybe 20 of us, and we had already been there for a couple of days, watching shows and fun threatre stuff. 

And there was this boy, he was a senior and not really at all my type, plus I had hardly talked to him before this trip. The first time I actually spoke with him was on a way to a restaurant with a small group of us and drama happened when we got there and the guy quielty sat, put his head on the table and cried for a minute or two. 

It was akward, yes, but I felt bad for the guy and I had honestly never seen him emotional in any way so I just tried to keep up conversation with everyone else to give him a moment of space. That wasn't the thing that got me, though. 

It was the last day of the trip. I hadn't really seen or talked to him that much, but he asked some of us if we wanted smoothies? We were getting ready for the last show of the trip, and I told him yeah, gave him some cash and my request. We all met at the theater and he handed me my drink. During the show, I drank through my smoothie, and when everyone exited, I passed by him and thanked him for grabbing it for me. He smiled right at me, like the purest smile and somehow so attractive I felt like I was going to fall over. He was facing a window so his face just lit up with golden light and I don't think I'll ever forget it.

After that, I began to pay more attention to him and every new quality I notoced, I liked. He was a good friend, a hard worker, intelligent and funny. By the time I'd gain the courage to ask him out, it was almost the end of the year, and he told me he didn't feel the same.

"Being ""stupid"" is more insulting than being ""weak"".",6,"There has been this age old discussion of ""Brains vs Brawns"", that I think is coming to a conclusion.

While the easy answer might be ""they are both needed"", this is short sighted, and on a much larger scale than just ""myself"", I feel it's intellectual things that have improved life. Bad people use good things for bad reasons, sure, but that's just more argument that teaching is important, so we don't have uneducated ""bad"" people anymore.

If you like power, especially for controlling purposes, then you might think ""weak"" is an insult. But with the internet, using power to silence people has become so much harder, that ""now-a-days"" a young adult, with a cell phone on the internet, is an informed ""know-it-all"". This is a real thing now. But, most people are just living their daily lives, not looking to stomp on the weak, just doing our jobs, spending time with family, etc... We don't care if you call us weak.

But in my experience, a LOT of people, from all walks of life, get mad when you call them stupid. It is an ""insult"" that can be thrown at anyone.

If your path doesn't care about being ""smart"", the result might be ""stupid"", right... Right?

"My very simple plan to end all wars in the world, everywhere",12,"My very simple plan to end all wars in the world, everywhere

The plan has three simple steps:

Step one: Every president/government of each country in the world signs a document agreeing to cut by 5% their military budget IF every other country in the world also agrees to cut by 5% their military budget. (It would be hard to find a reason not to sign this because it would make one look like a war loving bad guy)

Step two: Once every one of the 195 countries in the world has signed the document, we just do it, starting from 1 january 2024 every country's military budget is 5% smaller than the one for 2023.

Step three: Rinse and repeat , we do the same thing and cut the budgets by 5 more % in the year 2025, then by five more percent in the year 2026, and so on until we reach a goal we agreed on, for exemple every country having 5, or 10, or 0? percent of their current military budgets.

A Thought-Provoking Theory: The Impact of French Cuisine on the English Language,1,"Have you ever pondered the major transformation in English pronunciation, known as the Great Vowel Shift, which occurred between the 14th and 18th centuries? This shift essentially marked the transition from Middle to Modern English. I have been looking into why this happened and i have come up with my own unconventional theory: could the introduction of French food to England have indirectly influenced this linguistic shift?

Post the Norman Conquest of 1066, French culinary influence permeated England, leading to a significant shift from traditional coarse English food to softer, more refined French cuisine. This modification in diet, while seemingly irrelevant to language, could have had long-term implications on the physical structure of English speakers over generations.

Our early English human ancestors consumed a diet consisting of tough, unprocessed foods, necessitating strong jaw muscles and robust facial structures. These characteristics facilitated the pronunciation of certain sounds. However, a diet comprising softer, easier-to-chew food – the type introduced by the French – would require less jaw strength, potentially leading to less robust facial features and smaller jaws over time.

This brings us to the crux of our theory: could these changes in facial structure have made it easier for people to pronounce sounds at the front of the mouth rather than at the back? This is, in essence, the main characteristic of the Great Vowel Shift, which saw the 'fronting' of long vowel sounds.

It's crucial to note, of course, that this theory is purely speculative. Language evolution is a complex process influenced by a multitude of factors, not just diet, and significant physical changes take generations to manifest. Furthermore, genetic factors undoubtedly play a crucial role in the development of our craniofacial structures.Nonetheless, it's an stupid thought i had that kept me up last night and didn't know where else to share it.",13t7dac,lordpyruvate,1685193748.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/13t7dac/a_thoughtprovoking_theory_the_impact_of_french/,,Randomthoughts

Every day before I go to sleep I have the urge to turn my life around.,426,"Every night (roughly around 5 am) I have a sudden heightened sense of urgency to change my life - a new set of principles to live by, exercise routines, hobbies to start, even the urge to learn Spanish.

I always tell myself “I’ll do it one day, just not today” It seems simple enough to just try them slowly one-by-one the next day, but that sense of urgency disappears. I want to do it, but my mind just says nah im good. The mind works in funny ways - ways I might never understand.

The human species only has two biological sexes,1015,"Biological sex refers to an organism’s role in sexual reproduction. From the species level, this involves the possible gamete forms that are conducive to reproduction. 

The human species only has two viable gametes: spermatozoa (male gamete) and the oocyte (female gamete). 

There are no other viable gametes, thus the human species only has two sexes. 

Individuals who do not produce a viable gamete (for whatever reason), do not have a unique viable biological sex; they have a medical condition that prevents them from expressing one of the two gametes. 

A common rebuttal I hear is “what about XXY, X, and XXX individuals? Surely, they’re proof of more than 2 sexes.”

Here is why I think it’s wrong. 

Individuals with kleinfelters, Turner, or Triple X syndromes are by-and-large infertile. They do not produce viable gametes. 

In the rare cases in which they are fertile, *they still produce one of the 2 gametes*. They do not produce a unique, third gamete. 

Thus, there are still 2 biological sexes. 

I’m sure some will say I’m “lacking compassion” for this post. It couldn’t be the furthest from the truth. 

I think all individuals with Kleinfelters, Turner, Triple X, AIS, (you name it) deserve our utmost empathy. 

I just prefer bitter truths over compassionate lies. 

There are only two biological sexes in the human species, and there is no scientific evidence indicating otherwise.",ovczmy,crazyDocEmmettBrown,1627758416.0,1717,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/ovczmy/the_human_species_only_has_two_biological_sexes/,,Randomthoughts

If I know you're cheating on your spouse/partner I'm telling them,568,"There is an addition at the end.

I know a lot of people say that's not their business and that's fair but I think it's kind of unfair to know someone getting backstabbed and you say nothing. Cheating breaks people and some even committed suicide because of how heartbroken they were. Like I don't even care if my friend/family asks me not to tell. Especially if I'm close to the partner I'll be hurt if you knew my spouse was betraying me and you didn't say anything cuz it's not your business. I could leave them and move on if you did that. That person shouldn't think their relationship is fine while you having fun with someone else. Yeah, it's difficult to break it off but it's not fair for them. Y'all can break up and they can learn to love themselves again and eventually find the one for them. And you holding yourself and them back for what? Most of the time you will know the relationship is over so end it or try to work it out. Some people who cheat leave to be with their affair partner anyway so why are you struggling much? I'm trying to look down on nobody but I said what I said. P.S you should also give your betrayed partner an apology if you did cheat.


This is an addition to the post☝🏾
So I look over all of the comments to see everyone's perspective on what I think. It was overall a mixed bag of opinions that were insightful and I'm glad I got to read them. I tried to respond as much as possible I couldn't get to them all, unfortunately. But here are some of my new thoughts and ideas I will like to add. First I will like to add that making sure you understand the situation is key and you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Second, if you do tell be careful most people won't take it too kindly even if you're just trying to help. Third, if you do say anything be careful. I still believe that cheating is wrong however the only exception is if it's a toxic relationship and that's it. As well as that a cheater should take accountability. 

I was originally gonna delete this post since some of you thought it was ok to give me death threats (really mature 🙄)

Becoming pregnant made me pro-abortion,423,"I have always been torn on abortion because I saw it as 2 lives of equal importance. Now, when I got pregnant (and it was planned and I love it) it suddenly hit me that I was wrong.

Nobody should be forced to make such a huge sacrifice as to grow a fetus they did not want from the start. I tried so hard to get pregnant only to have the most awful first trimester. I cannot imagine how it feels to have all these symptoms while not looking forward to holding a baby in your arms. It's just too much to ask for.

Also, while I still believe that the fetus holds life and that by aborting it, you are basically taking a life, the life of the mother has priority, because she is the one who is the primary caregiver. You should not force anybody into that role. This role is huge. I pity any child and mother who are forced onto each other.

"If the Christian Afterlife exists, would it cause you to eventually go insane?",1013,"First, I’m agnostic but was raised very Christian. I’ve read the Bible about twelve times all the way through, took Bible classes in a Christian school, and spent my life (until I was 18) attending church three times a week. That’s my background and why I tend to think about these things so much, despite not actually being religious anymore. 

Anyway, many Christians believe that the Afterlife has you sitting around and worshipping God for eternity. You will live in endless bliss and know nothing but joy. But let’s just focus on the part about it being eternal. If that’s true, how would the human mind cope with that eternity? How would you never get bored? 

Now let’s assume you’re living in bliss. If that’s true, wouldn’t you eventually get used to it?

If Heaven is real, how would you live forever without getting bored or used to the new normal? Would the fact that you could never end such an existence create a Hell out of Heaven? Would you long for nothingness once you’ve lived long enough?

"If you reject a felon who applied for a job in a labor shortage and still complain that you ""cannot find help"": You lose your right to complain since you're doing it to yourself.",137,"Edit: While I appreciate all the comments and stories people have shared for and against this general message, it is time to clear a few things up with this heavily polarized topic:

This post is in relation to jobs that have a legal standing to hire felons.  I recognize that some state and federal laws prohibit felons for taking on very specific job types; however, these jobs are often noted in a job description.  If a request states ""a criminal record doesn't automatically disqualify you from being a potential applicant"" and there are many job fields and employers that will hire felons.  However this is targeted towards employers that receive qualified or trainable applicants, but deny just based on a criminal record when they have a dramatic need for employment help.  Because here is the thing: If you're having a hard time finding help, this means you have a low amount of applicants to begin with because of a variety of reasons or there are other undisclosed reasons or reputations. In a general business and a business makes comments saying they cannot find help, but they have applicants in general, but refuse any help, that's on them and they have zero room to complain.  Same applies for businesses that have limited applicants and when felons do apply, but automatic services often auto-deny these classes of individuals, hurting potential employment prospects.

To clear a second notion up: I'm not saying hire felons because they are felons.  That's like saying hire that kid just because they are young.  I'm saying treat a felons application like any other applicant and ignore past history.  Give equal opportunity and focus on skills, willingness to adapt, and what that person can bring to the table in your company.  If they are a good fit, hire them.  If not, move onto the next applicant.

A third notion: Sex offenders are the lowest of the low when it comes to criminal offenses where even other felons want to see them dead.  Yes there are innocent people behind that dark veil, but adding this  way over complicates things more than it needs to be.  Most felons whom are released and trying to function are drug, property, or civil order crimes.",pljdvk,Zero_Sacron,1631274255.0,907,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/pljdvk/if_you_reject_a_felon_who_applied_for_a_job_in_a/,,Randomthoughts

Why do homeless people live in cold places?,130,"Now, I completely appreciate a lot of homeless people are addicts and have just given up on some sort of better life but for some they are trying to get back on their feet or they simply don't want to conform to society and are happy homeless (I've seen a few short films, interviews, documentaries where this is the case)

Anyway..

I stopped on the street a few months back to give a nice homeless guy (Connor) some food and we started talking. 
The subject moved over to how he wasn't looking foward to the winter incoming. He said he'd always had the dream to live somewhere warm where its beautiful weather all year round and that he actually kinda likes being homeless in the summer months. We kept talking and it turned out he actually still had a valid passport (apart from adress of course) and after googling, could perfectly legally get a cheap flight to Gibraltar or another British territory and live there. We got carried away chatting about this and after 15mins or so I had to go. 

A few days went by and I saw him again (I see him regularly on the way to and from work) we spoke again about the dream of living somwhere warmer (homeless or not) and he said he had actually started saving up for a ticket to the sum of (£28)
I was taken back by his motivation, without thinking went to the cashpoint and withdrew £200 and gave it to him. I offered to take him to the airport and he accepted.
As we parked at the terminal he started crying saying how much it means to him, that he won't have to go through another winter trying to stay warm.
I gave him my business card and told him to keep in contact and let know how he gets on if he can.
I wanted to make sure he made it through the terminal so we both went in to buy the ticket to Gibraltar (a british territory south of spain) and after just over an hour I watched him go through.

Now I know I helped him out with the money but he had saved £28 in a few days so he was actually capable of getting the ticket on his own. Also in the UK we need a passport to go anywhere further than Cornwall so I appreciate it would have been a lot more difficult if he didn't still have one. But in the USA for example you can just make your way down south, florida etc? 

Now to sum up personally I can't think of anything worse than freezing on the cold wet streets. After watching documentaries on homelessness and talking to Connor the main worry is surviving the winter.

Oh and I got a postcard from Connor this morning which was my motivation to write this. 
He's actually got a part time job picking litter. And is thankful to be there. And yes I cried..

Whats everyone's thoughts? I know I'd rather be homeless in paradise than here.

Update: 

I'm going on holiday to Gibraltar in the next few weeks to visit Connor! He said he's buying me a drink when I get there. Super excited!",pmrc78,OkExercise3560,1631447682.0,839,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/pmrc78/why_do_homeless_people_live_in_cold_places/,,Randomthoughts

No, cops aren’t perfect, but humans aren’t either. I totally agree if they can’t handle their responsibilities correctly, they need to find another line of work, or be held accountable for inaction. But the hatred and divide is getting to the point where it’s becoming dare I say, more and more permissible to dismiss law and order. 

The amount of excuses I see Redditors make for literal criminals committing criminal acts is getting insane. Society can’t turn into the lord of the flies just because it’s not cool to support cops.

Prisons should be forced to give life insurance to inmates,561,"Edit 2: I understand how life insurance works. In this specific case the prison itself would pay be responsible for wrongful death in any case other than suicide or natural causes. Most US prisons for example are for-profit prisons which means they have as little security as possible in order to make sure their own guards are safe and still be profitable. 

Edit: For those saying I don't know anything about the prison system: The whole point of this post is that I disagree with the way most prisons are ran and think there should be radical change, especially in the US where most prisons are for-profit. There has to be a better way to do things.

Yes, it's cold. Yes, there are a lot of days you go hungry. Yes, it sucks. But it's mostly FUCKING BORING. Did you know that most people who are homeless and addicted to drugs only became addicted to drugs *after* they became homeless? Seriously, look it up. It's been studied. 

And you know why? Because homelessness is: 

A - fucking depressing and a pick me up doesn't sound like such a terrible idea after a while, especially if it's being given to you for free

B - FUCKING BORING and under-stimulating. And drugs are fun...for a short time until they are not.

A in combination with B is the perfect storm to create drug addiction.

**Please stop commenting ""there's more than five senses"", that's not the point of this question. My question refers to whatever senses you count, whether it be the main five or the ones I've never heard of prior to making this post like proprioception or equilibrioception. I can't edit the title, thats not my fault. But I'm referring to a theoretical sense that we dont know about, that's why it's hypothetical. Thank you!**

We have bodily functions that help you perceive the world. Yes, I now know there are more than 5 main ones apparently but the most commonly referenced ones are touch, smell, taste, sight and hearing, thats what I grew up learning so I apologize for the title, I can't edit it.

People have body parts used to experience those senses. All I'm trying to say is hypothetically, what if there were more senses that we don't know about that the world offers, that we can never experience due to not having the proper body part for it (like needing a nose to smell or eyes to see).

How are men supposed not to sexualize women bodies when so many women just sexualize themselves?,304,"I hope this doesn't offend anyone, and that I don't sound sexist, but I'm genuinely interested. So the word is, nipples, boobs, whatever shouldn't be sexualized. But if you go on the internet, it is everywhere. Obviously I'm not talking about porn, but so many girls ""explore their sexuality"" on the 'gram/reddit/other SM and just the sheer amount of people having onlyfans. Many celebrities are so sexy-forward (for the lack of a better word), just posting like half-nude erotica pics. 95/100 women who play an instrument (drums/guitars/bass) are just shooting their videos wearing sexy outfits and shit, and these days 2/3 of these videos are just about this (they don't even really play the instrument or play it like for 5 seconds of a 15 second video). I'm almost 30 and I don't understand this.

EDIT: okay guys gals and non binary pals I wanna thank some of you for their thoughtful replies. Some of them, not so much though. I wanna clarify that maybe I misread the notion of “sexualization” and I never talked about it in contest of actually doing something to a girl because she looks sexy or something, it is something that stays ONLY inside one’s thoughts. Stuff like touching or making disrespectful comments or assuming that the sexy person is question is just a vag with legs is borderline inhumane and I never even had this in mind. 

Also I would like to say that I don’t have problems with this because my sex life is good I’ll have you know and honestly what I described just bothers me in general terms.

She responded with a phone call and we had a really pleasant conversation in which she worked up to telling me that the feeling was not mutual. I told her I respected how she felt, but that I would be heartbroken if we were to stop being friends because of this. We still hang out, and laugh and smile, and it’s wonderful.

Some will call me a cuck, some will call me a simp… you’re welcome to think what you want but I’m truly happy with our friendship as it is.

The bitter “Nice Guy” types and the bitter “Blue Hair” Woke SJWs should just get together and have sex. They’d all be happier for it.,192,"Ok so back in the day, these two types of people were the ones that ended up together. The “nice guys” and the “blue hairs” were never the hottest and most popular. And they grew up and realized “hey you know what? I’ll settle for something in my league”. They would get together and most likely be happy because they entered a relationship based on understanding and respect not just looks.


But that doesn’t happen anymore because the internet has allowed both groups to essentially become echo chambers of bitterness. The “Nice guys” cry about not dating hot girls with porn-star bodies, and the “blue hairs” complain that men are disgusting pigs that can’t handle them.

Just both sides shut up and get laid with each other.  you’ll be so much happier and less bitter.

Asking strangers what they pay in rent these days is actually a really good conversation starter.,257,"It's not a particularly invasive question while still personal enough that it escalates from small talk pretty quickly--and it's perfectly reasonable to ask a stranger without overtly trying to get to know them.  It gets them talking about the city or town they're in and perhaps you can bond over recognized landmarks or learn more about a new city you're in; you can even use that to transition from favorite restaurants to food in general or from recent movies that have come out in the local theater to movie tastes in general. Depending on the reception, you can even vent about frustrations you may have with the prospect of moving or have them open up about their own life as well. So far I've never had a negative experience with this.  Thoughts?

Edit: evidently the consensus here is a net negative... Points taken folks!

Edit 2:  so the comments are negative, but the votes are positive?  I've never seen this happen before and I'm not sure what to make of it.  Still, if the question gets this much backlash at all, I figure it's not best to lean on it as a consistent friend maker.

YouTube made a boiling frog experiment on it's users,144,"First they introduced skippable ads. You have to wait just a little five seconds and you can watch your intented video. Of course this act brought a lot of attention but YouTube didn't back down.

Second they introduced unskippable ads. But they were only five seconds just like before. Plus this time you didn't even have to press a skip button after the ad ended. This brought attention too but lesser.

They geared up the process and made unskippable five second ads to unskippable thirty seconds ads. Lastly they made combinations of skippable and unskippable ads. Ads started to come back to back, at end of the video, refreshed pages etc.

This should have made users more angry and aware but everytime YouTube introduced new strategy old one looked more tolerable and people gave less reaction.

Or it could be YouTube planned on people to buy premium nonetheless. Using ads as a pushing factor.",tktftc,Kullanici1234,1648040553.0,491,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/tktftc/youtube_made_a_boiling_frog_experiment_on_its/,,Randomthoughts

I took a dive into the sub FemaleDatingStrategy and here are my thoughts,94,"As an actual married woman, while I did find some posts to be relatable, I also saw a lot of something else-- **fear**.

I tried to post on the subreddit, ""What Marriage Has Taught Me,"" and it was instantly removed. **INSTANTLY**. Confused as to why that is, I read in the community rules that:

1. There is an automated bot that removes and blocks pretty much anything that goes with anti-feminine energy.
2. You literally cannot post on that sub until you have shoved enough 'ghost' comments that agree with everything that you see, or else you are banned. I call them ghost comments, because they will never see the light of darkness on that page unless a mod deems you as *feminist enough*.
   1. Are you actually a feminist if you don't call each other out on your shit? hmm, I don't knowwwww.
3. You cannot appear as argumentative-- pretty much number one but with some splash to it. You cannot disagree with anyone or else they see it as an argument. And I want to be clear -- **disagreement does not mean argumentative!**

Doing a 360 back to the intro about the fear aspect because this is important, and honestly, I do hope their mods see this post and reflect (it's called growth); **Everyone has red flags**. Every single being on this planet, yes you too women (as I myself-- a woman, has red flags). The fear of a man having **ANY** red flags is ultimately what is going to lead so many women on that sub to be single for the rest of their lives or create such a deep internal fear of the red flags that they do not see and avoid the most important red flags such as domestic violence, pedophilia, dangerous sexual fantasies, etc. And that is incredibly sad. Having fear is a good thing, but having irrational fear is a bad thing.

I am not saying that just because I am married that I have a better view on relationships, however a lot of the things that they list as red flags, are things and qualities that I even have and my partner lol! He would not be my husband if I left because I had to nag him a few times a month! That is ridiculous. I would say that as a married woman, what I have over a lot of those posts is common sense of what a real relationship is. The amount of work in a relationship is **ENDLESS!** It is about **communication**, not throwing in the towel because you are nagging??? It is a '**give-give**' and sometimes I'm giving more than he is and sometimes he is giving more than I am. That is life. That is love. That is how to maintain longevity.

To conclude this long post, I really want to highlight the discussion of; **not every woman's story is going to turn out to be yours and not every man in those stories is going to turn out to be the man that you are seeing or interested in**. As a survivor of sexual assault, I personally did not want to put the burden of what a man did to me onto any man that I dated in the future. I am not saying that I was not cautious, however, I knew and know that not every man is him. So, as a result of this thought process, I lived my best life and I do not regret it! I had a great time in my dating stage-- I was open, I was free, and most importantly I am still living my best life with my amazing husband. Had I lived with a dooming fear that every man would be like my abuser, I would not have allowed my husband to love me, to take care of me, and to **GROW** with me. re-read this paragraph and reflect.

side note: My husband has what I call ""horizon-vision"", meaning that he does not look at objects on the floor to pick them up-- super red flag /s.

:) Thank's guys.

&#x200B;

Edit: The red flags that these women are describing are not actually ""Red Flags"", they are characteristics in men that they deem as flaws.

For Young Women in America,195," I was lucky. My birth control never failed me. I was a different person as a young woman...I would have been the worst mother in the world. I'd still hoard the child even if I was sick with rage in caring for it. I was traumatized and had a severe anger problem. I was a fucking girl, and I wasn't ready. Now I am....

  The sheer volume of what I've learned and how far I've come - Instead of poisoning this world with more pain, I will heal it. I am emotionally and financially ready.


  If I were a young woman today, I'd be as terrified of pregnancy and birth as I was then. I'd probably be a 30 y/o Virgin, and who knows if I'd die before that.

Edit: thanks for the replies, I appreciate most of them. But I wanna say some things because I'm tired to tell everyone 😊 I don't want something perfect. Nobody is perfect, so I can't expect a relationship to be perfect. But I know I want to feel ""something"" I just can't explain what. I guess I will know when the time comes. Also I love myself, my friends and my family and I'm happy. I'm trying to be a better person every day, I learn something new every day and maybe I will find the one in the way. And I know there are bad times, I know relationships are not always rainbow and unicorns. I also don't tell you need to tolarate every shit your partner do (drugs, extreme jealousy, anger problems.. etc) the most important thing is a healthy relationship and it goes both ways. I'm just saying we should love our partner with their little flaws (because we are not perfect). Every person should try to be their best versions, and I think it's enough. I also don't want a relationship right now, it's just something I wish for the future, so I am okay with waiting, searching (or whatever you want to call it). You don't have to agree with me.
