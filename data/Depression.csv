I’m worried depressed partner is staying with me because he doesn’t want to hurt me again,0,"Every time something stressful comes up he tries to stop talking to me. Most recently I told him it’s ok if he just asks for space to adjust, and that he doesn’t need to completely cut me off. During that conversation I told him that if this is the last time I see him I want him to know that I loved him and never stopped, and he pretty much told me that he wished he could feel that way but he doesn’t feel much of anything towards anyone right now. I’m starting to worry if he just isn’t into me anymore and is only talking to me because he’s hurt me in the past.",13wam26,owmyankles,1685502577.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13wam26/im_worried_depressed_partner_is_staying_with_me/,,Depression

But most of my memories aren’t the best I don’t really remember what it’s like to be happy I think the last time I was happy was back in 2015 but I still was having ups and downs during that time .

I just wish it was all over,0,"I always think about if there was a button to press that would immediately end my life, I would press it instantly. 

my partner said if I really wanted to kms I would have done it by now. am I a coward. I can’t even off myself correctly. long story short, I hung myself the other day, in my closet, I passed out but at some point my graduation sash broke. I started throwing up after that. 

my partner says I owe it to him to be alive bc he will be sad forever, but truth is I wish we never met. I am so depressed. There’s been so much trauma. I’m just over it. I fantasize about jumping off every high building and bridge I see, I live near La. I don’t want to do this anymore. 
I’m pregnant but the symptoms are so severe where I’m throwing up multiple times at work at home, everywhere. my partner says it’ll be too stressful etc. 
I don’t want to go through with an abortion. But I’m struggling at work because I throw up like once an hour. Im not noticeably pregnant yet, especially because of the uniform apron and such. I just look like a hungover mess to some coworkers and the customers. I’ve heard customers make fun of me, saying I look like I’m from prison, laughing because I look upset etc. 

When I was 7 I wrote my first suicide note. I thought it would get better when I was 14, now I’m 23, 24 June 13th. 

There’s just been more trauma in my life. 
I can’t do it anymore. 

I just want it all to end. I don’t want to think. I’ve tried therapy, medication, etc. my partner just tells me I don’t try. 

I don’t know what I’m living for anymore, I don’t want to be here. I haven’t for as long as I remember, and it doesn’t get better.",13wa5xd,bunnyjuless,1685501326.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13wa5xd/i_just_wish_it_was_all_over/,,Depression
Impasse,1,"Here I am, at the same impasse once more. I don’t want to be here, I’ve been trying so incredibly hard. I thought I was past it, but like always I’m reminded that I’m not meant to be happy. I wish more than anything that my suicide attempt had been successful, but I’m still here. Why? Why can I not find happiness? Why am I forced to still face another day of sadness? Of grief? Of feeling like I don’t matter to anyone? Like the world would be a better place if I just didn’t exist? Or maybe it wouldn’t change at all. I don’t affect anyone’s life in any way. I wish I could just disappear. I just want to go far away and never have to come back. I want to go to sleep and not have to wake up. I’m just done.

Brain fog,1,"I don't know how long this has been going on, it comes and goes. But the effects are always terrible. I have a routine when brushing my teeth. Brush each side by counting to 20, the front ones another 20, brush the tongue, use mouth wash, use face soap, keep it on, use the tongue scraper then rinse everything off. Since my brain fog I've been skipping some of these steps, on the good days I just forget the tongue scraper or brushing my tongue, on the bad days I just use mouthwash, on the really bad ones I don't do anything at all and go to my bed. I feel disgusting but I can't do it for some reason. And now I just skipped my shower. I feel terrible but I can't go inside the shower for some reason. I work at a fast food chain, they make it mandatory to shower daily, but I didn't do it. I'm tired of feeling this way and just writing this is tiring me out. I just stay on the couch all day watching TV and then occasionally drink water. I just remember the water part because of my family's many comments on my weight. Please, I just want this fog to go away already, I'm not sure how much more I can take. I already self harm myself, no permament damage though. I don't think I can take the gossip that comes with it. Both sides of my family are terrible gossipers and I don't want them to speak bad about my mom. They already outcast her as the divorced parent with low funds. I don't want them to give them anymore reasons to speak badly about her. I just want everything to end but then I'll just make my mom a target. But I'm not sure how much longer I can take. I just want to cry, but no one will listen to me. Not actually. My mom is great but she wouldn't understand too. If anyone finished reading this, thank you. You now know more about my mental state than anyone I actually know. Please give me advice, and I think I'll speak to my doctor next time I get a check-up.

I lost my battle and i need help.,3,"\[Hello, first of all i would like to underline english isn't my first language so if there are mistakes i am really sorry \[26M\] \]  


Years ago i went throught therapy and i felt like everything was fixed at least but i knew i had to keep fight to keep me on my feet but honestly? I'm tired, tired to keep fighting with my depression, i can't take it anymore, it seem this feeling it's like a second skin  honestly life it's kinda tought with me but tonight i just fall, i really feel hopeless i lost motivation for everything not even reading books or play videogames bring me joy \[yeah kinda standard hobbies but helped me to ''cope'' with this situation.\]  
i don't feel joy, anger and this even surprise me since before therapy i had a really bad anger-managment issues, i forgot the last time i slept good without waking up in the night and crying for hours, the only thing i feel it's tiredness and mental fatigue as if my brain it's in a fog  and refuse to fight.  


I've tried to talk about my mental health with my parents and as much as they love me and care about me it doesn't seem they take it really seriously and honestly i don't think to talk about it either with my friends because i see them keep moving throught their life, achieving goals and beign happy while i feel stuck in this endless limbo not knowing and also beign scared of what my future life will be because of this problem, i feel like whatever i'll do in my life won't be enough to feel good or to achieve even the smallest goal.  


The only things i do now it's to chain smoke \[i would literally obliterate a pack of 30g of tobacco in not even 2 days.\]  and drinking energy drink to keep me wake since i need to study and finish school i also dropped that because of this fucking problem , i lost apetite the only reason i eat it's to don't allarm my parents because if they get allarmed it will go to the first point i mentioned, i tried to ask some favour like doing some little trips \[Nothing special, just something to break the monotony of my city and discover new stuff\] but they always say ''We will see.'' and never do anything or it will simply take forever to say a yes.  


  
So in the end, like a last resort i'm texting this wall of text to find any solution or at least an advice with an english that i hope you all can undestand.  


I don't pretend to be all happy and rainbow i know life it's a bitch but what a fuck, i just want to rest because honestly i'm starting to feel the inevitable because the only thing i want it's to rest and feel good with myself.

Baby mama new boyfriend,0,"So I found out the last week the mother of my child has a new boyfriend. She told me specifically; we've been broken up for about a year and, even with some initial resentment on both sides (we were only together a couple months before she got pregnant and then the last year of our relationship was pretty much a one-way trip to apathetic hatred) we've managed to establish a pretty amicable acquaintanceship for the good of our son. We split everything down the middle as far as taking care of him goes and we even are capable of small talk here and there.

Last week the small talk went a little far, for my taste, apparently. She mentioned she was dating someone new (it came up organically to some extent so not like she was being a dick about it), but man...it really rubbed me the wrong way. And not even the way that someone would probably assume: I think our relationship was shit. We barely knew each other when she got pregnant and then we go to learn a whoooole lot about each other very quickly. Honeymoon phase: immediately over. Sex became at first a rarity and then basically non existent for most of our relationship. We griped and didn't really do shit besides sit around. We didn't really have similar senses of humor. We just became more and more alienated from each other, as any shitty relationship does over time. And I'm sure the pregnancy had a lot to do with that, but also it's hard to imagine us ever working out in the long term.

But that's what sucks. I can't end things like any other shitty relationship completely. I mean... she's my kid's mom lol. I have to still remain in contact with her. And to some extent be in her life. Just like she has to be in mine. And right now I HATE THAT SHIIIIIT. I just wanna be away from her and all the life choices that got me to this point so bad. I've had such shit luck with so many relationships/dating and it just feels like I'm too screwed in the head to even find anyone foreal. But the best part is now I'm trapped here! (At least for the time being). 

And don't get me wrong: I love the fuck outta my son. Even if I was initially terrified to have a kid, he's become the one bright spot in my life. But sometimes that makes things harder. Because I see her walk away with him in her arms and i just get reminded of the hope and the promises and the ""we can be a family together"" encouragement she used to give me. And it just makes my whole situation in life feel like a big phony lie. Like I get to feel bad over a relationship I didn't even give a fuck about. And it's like....for what? Why, emotions? Just leave me be please lol",13w9h2s,Eli5195,1685499449.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13w9h2s/baby_mama_new_boyfriend/,,Depression

Tomorrow is a new day to reminisce on yesterday when things were better. Things just are never going to be the way they were and maybe I need to admit to myself that I ruined it. Disappear from here and let you live your life free of me. I can't bear the thought. I wish I could just stop thinking. Stop focusing on the fact that you are always at the center of my mind. Kept callously at arm's length even there, it makes me sad, and angry, and then I breath and imagine your smile and it's like this on loop. I've gone mad for sure, so crazy it feels like the wait has gotten heavy and my legs are about to give out because I can't stop running the wheels for a living anymore. I do it for us. I do it for what I dream for. I dream for us. why is being in the dark worse than being alone? it's unfortunate that I have a fear of both and that's why every day is a nightmare that I endure because I dream for us.

Recovery tips during short leave of absence,0,"Hi all. Some background: my mental health has deteriorated to the point where I got super burnt out and had a breakdown recently. Felt like I exhausted the tools available to me; therapy, meds, school resource support, etc. It’s gotten to the point where I’m taking a one month leave of absence from my PhD program. It recently got approved and I’ve got a couple more half days of finishing experiments before I can really rest. 

All of this to say I’m so exhausted. Like the only reason I’m able to get out of bed in the morning while I’m finishing my work is because my boyfriend repeatedly tells me to and rips off the blankets. I can barely shower or make myself food. Focusing on much is damn near impossible. I know a lot of those non-medical recovery tips involve going outside, getting exercise etc. and I want to get to the point where I can do that but right now I just… can’t. Walking from my parked car to my work building today was a challenge. 

So, where do I start? How do I start this recovery process from the ground? I’m in therapy, on medication (that I’m likely getting changed again soon cause it’s not working lol), I’m starting a DBT group for my anxiety disorder next week. I’m so fucking sick of being so tired and dreading the start of every day but also being so bored that my brain spirals to places it shouldn’t go.",13w7vro,EnsignEmber,1685495106.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13w7vro/recovery_tips_during_short_leave_of_absence/,,Depression
Memento of what i am and my failures,0,"I don't expect a reply.I don't expect a response.

I'm creating this again as a reminders of what i am and my failures. Alive or not, i don't care.Especially i don't have anyone else, family or friends, that i can trust or believe anymore.

============================================================

I came from a country in South East Asia and ""managed"" to move to a different country hoping for better life.I struggled with my identity and my future at the end on my Uni life.Struggled with getting a job.Able to get a couple of jobs but ended up in short term since they didn't suit me. I took them just because peer and social pressure for not having a job and i need money.Other than those two jobs, i had been jobless for years. That's when i graduated 2013-2018, years being a jobless.

At the end of 2017-2018, my dad lost his job since he's been working with my uncle. ""Family Business"" my ass. I realised from that point that working in family business will never work. He got fired because he and my mom gave advice to his son, his nephew and my cousin.Lost his job. His sole AND small income from this A\*hole cousin.This event cracked/destroyed/snapped my life and personality and i have been in deep end of depression. Lots and lots of thought for death and dying.

I only had two choices: Death or move to different country.Why would you ask? I have been years being jobless in my own country.I HATE my origin country SO MUCH to the point that i don't care anymore if it burns to the ground.I will clap my hand if it destroyed.

Managed to find a school to continue my study in other countries and landed a job.Sound a better life right? WRONG.

My parents now asking for financial support since it's IMPOSSIBLE to get a job due to old age in that stupid country. And with COVID happened, everything is getting more expensive + the state of world's economy right now.I tried to get better to help someone as well, as per recommendation from counsellor.What i got is losing more money. Almost all money gone to help a person since i tried to help their life better.Tried medication and another counsellor, it just made things worse.

From now on, i don't care anymore if i'm dead or not.I'm done being a person who's ""trying"". No more being kind without any benefit.Everyone can be gone or i'm gone.That person and my parents dead, i don't care. It's better since i would have less burden.This life doesn't want me so why should i care.People can go to war, destroy this world, burn everything to the ground, i don't care anymore.Living is just a stupid way to experience no progression and/or being a slave.

Nobody cares and helps me in real, WHY should i care?

My True Love,1,"I am 45 and 4 years ago I met an amazing person.

I had the privilege to see her proactiveness to help me. She was always helpful but serious.

She was brilliant and made minutes to fly with perfect classes. Sometimes things would happen in such a simple manner. but there was always an execution so right. so effective. I longed for those lessons.

I started praying for her when God told me to. (Sorry, for respect of those who don't believe, I will not dwell on the subject). This is just to tell you that I already admired her but at this point I started caring for her very much. 

I then I feel in love which ended up in disagreement and I lost the classes that were the best Italian lessons I ever had. Her colleague was a good teacher as well, but ...

I was depressed before the first lesson but I got so much worse. I tend to eat more to cope with anxiety and frustration and I was so much worse that my stomach was in severe pain, i could not eat nor sleep. 

i left but i never. i feel i need to talk to her to be set free of the trauma of our disagreement. But the indication is that she hates me very much and doesn't care to see me suffer or feel guilty for me abandoning the course because of her.

So, this year I went back because she seems to have left and I wanted to get rid of the trauma. I did not know how I was going to be received. It turns out her former advisor hates me. She mumbled things like ""How dare you coming back here."" when I passed by her. She has not given me the announcements she gave to other students and she does not reply when i have a doubt. 

So, I was getting sick again, I did not leave before because I wanted to die anyway. maybe I would colapse right there. But then the principal showed that he hates me as well so... I left. They would fail me anyway and I would not be able to fight it.

She was and is the only one who can get me out of this turmoil. Why wouldn't she? i cried so much when i heard things she went true. I've prayed in tears many times. I didn't get married, I don't have children, she's my baby somehow.

I'm over it,0,"I've been struggling with life for a long as I can remember, been wanting to unalive myself since I was around 6. Everyone keeps saying ""it gets better"" or similar and since I was about 25 I had heard it so much I get to the point of wanting to knock people out when they say it. Somehow, I've yet to actually do it though the shoulder and arm always tense up for a second when it's said

I've tried over the years to get help and either clammed up and lied throuhh my teeth to these so called professionals they thought my parents were legit crazy or get met with doctors who don't care/belittle me/or just straight up don't believe anything I say

I can't hold down a fucking job because I get so stressed out that I'm going to get fired for the slightest mistake that I end up just straight up melting down like a fucking child 

No one wants to be with me long term when it comes to dating (I'm certain I'm going to die alone) and then the few friends I do have..... fuck I don't know why they stay around because I'm a fucking mess that's constantly being help and I feel like a leech. Everyone else just leaves after they realize I'm a fucking waste of space. I can only imagine the few friends who do stick around are just feeling sorry for me cause they know I'm a pathetic loser

I haven't had the courage previously to end it but the mounting debt, the stress from it and life and just my general failure at everything I do is starting to give me the courage but I know me and I'll stop fuck it up and end up even worse off.

My life has just felt like a prison I can't break free from, my past mistakes, the big ones, play in my own built in hell loop that grows with each fuck up. I sleep like shit from it, I barely eat,  I'm just so fucking over everything

I don't know what I hoped to gain from this post, I doubt anything (not meant as an insult to the community here, I just know how broken I am) I'm just...... tired of it all. 

I did make this profile just for this community because I'm worried that if I either fail or bitch out on ending it someone would find this post with my actual account linked to it and use it against me. Just wanted to put that out there so I don't seem like a bot or like this is a bullshit post

Conflicting feelings.,0,"I'm writing this as a vent, something I might look at a few days from now and think, ""Damn, that's stupid"", but now, just for now i want to be ""silly"" and post something on a social network where no one knows me to judge me.

I have been dealing with my depression for 5 years now, I went through horrible phases, phases where I would rather die than have to get out of bed. Nowadays, I've learned to deal with it, know its moments and respect myself, but that doesn't mean it hurts less. 

Lately, I've been feeling lonely, suffocated, and lost. I'm hating and needing touch and affection, hating and wanting to be alone, hating the city I live in and the people and how much i have to suffer with this mental illness shit. 

I have been bothered by little things, feeling insecure, upset and afraid. I can't leave the house, because the outside world bothers me. It's loud and awful, I can hardly breathe or think. 

I know it's just another time where my depression kicks in again in full force, but it hurts. It hurts because I lose inspiration, the will and it hurts because I become dependent on the closest people.

It just... It hurts.

I don't know when this will pass, and I have so many responsibilities... God, that's a big shit.

I am on medication now and seeing a counselor.  Ive gained a bit of strength and a better feeling.  But the depression is still strong.  My counsler helped me identiffy triggers after she eplxined it to me.  It made me spot all kinds of triggers, I had never thought of before.  Its helped, but not completely.

I struggle with the dread feeling.

For me its a feeling of identifiable sadness, anger, with it sapping all of the motivation and joy out of me.  Giving me a feeling of severe sadness, but with no trigger.  At least I cant find it.  I spoke to my counselor today and he told me there must be one.

Other than that absolutely no one I could call  and just talk. My contacts list in the phone is almost empty and the people that are in there I'd rather never known. But it is what it is.. And since I've known myself I never had actual friends I enjoyed a company with...

I've met some people online and they are the only people I love and care about so much. But eventually they are not even my real friends. I don't know their numbers, can't call, can't meet, they live in other countries, the only time I can say something to them is sometimes when they are online and even that should be rare. I can't talk to them too often, I'm not a close friend to them, they are not talking me seriously, even if helping so much. And it's really painful to realize.

I’m feeling super depressed lately f21 could use someone to talk to.,3,"
So I'm f21. I have  a mom and a dad obviously and 2 sisters in HS. I live at home during the summer. Because I'm in college. And i don’t work much so I'm here alot. My parents both work at public schools so they're busy everyday. Basically my whole life they've been very mean  to me. my parents are always in a bad mood. And always tired. They never talk to me, ask me how I am or how my day was. They get really annoyed when I hangout with friends or go to the mall restaurants etc. They hate all my interests like for example whenever i play music they tell me turn it off and always make a comment. 

Mind you i do all my chores and i NEVER talk back to them. Recently I've been super depressed. I've been having really bad thoughts. 

I gained a little weight since the winter and it's making me go crazy. I have no motivation to workout. I feel like my life is meaningless. I also hate my past. In high school i was such a whore and a bad kid and i feel like my parents will always hate me for who i was. 

Also whenever i talk to people i knew in high school they always bring up my high school past. I hate who I used to be so much it eats at me all day everyday. Thats the main reason for my depression. I feel so worthless all the time. I want to disappear...run away or something.

"Been depressed for 15 years, I’m 25 now.",1,"When I was young I had a lot of traumatic experiences that made me become extremely introverted. Isolated myself and lived through a computer most of my childhood. I enclosed my self in a cage of contempt, insecurity, pain, etc. I just wanted to say, that depression is inherently a parasite in your mind, and it feeds off negative energy. Those words you say to yourself constantly, “ I hate myself, I deserve this, I am pathetic, I’m worthless, I’m this, I’m that,” they were never your words, they were the created by that parasite to reinforce its position, its power in your heart. Depression is a sentence, and you have to ask yourself, who gave you that sentence. Free yourself brethren. I’m in no condition to say I’ve been healed, and freed from my cage, but I am here to say the first step is admitting to yourself that all that negativity isn’t yours, those thoughts of suicide are not yours, the burden is not yours to hold, it’s just an illusion. I’m here to admit that I’ve been fooled, lied to , misled;  realize depression is not a reflection of what you are, but an illness, a disease, A PARASITE. 


If you think of suicide, or letting it destroy your life…

You need to think long and hard about that plan.
Because if you go through with it, you will die, one way or another.
A life of misery, loneliness and depression will destroy you.
In your mind you think you are making a choice that you want.You are not.You are making a choice that your depression wants.



Those thoughts of product of your depression, not your soul. Believe you are a victim, and realize you are not making those choices, thoughts. 

As for me, I am admitting this for the same reason, to admit I’m not in control, that I’m being controlled, and I will no longer abide the debasement. Love you all, and stay blessed.

Recurring Thoughts of Death,1,"24(F) I've been in a major depressive episode for a few days. I sometimes visualize stabbing myself with a knife and my boyfriend finding me dead. I love him so much and would never do that to him. But sometimes I wish I just got sick with an illness and died so I wouldn't have to keep living. I had cancer as a child and survived it but sometimes I wish I had just died then and there so I wouldn't have to suffer with mental illness. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 13.

I don't hate myself but I feel like a broken person because of issues I have. I have people who love me and I have a fear of pain so I would never take my own life. But I can't help feeling like I wish I was dead. I love sleeping because I can forget about depression for awhile. My therapist got a new job somwhere else and couldn't take all her clients with her so I haven't been to therapy in over two months.

Helpful Tips?,1,"I have struggled with depression on and off for most of my life. Currently I’ve been off all meds (besides for adhd) for about 6 years.

I have an amazing boyfriend of 3 years, but I don’t really have any close friends. He has so many hobbies, and so many things he is good at. Nothing really bothers him.

I so wish I could be that way. I wish I loved myself and didn’t get stressed and didn’t feel sad. I’m thinking of going back to therapy, but wondering if there are things in your daily life that help? I do try and eat decent and one of the only times I really feel good is when I’m outside, so I walk/hike a lot. But as soon as I’m home, especially when afternoon/ evening hits, I just get stabbed by so much pain.

My everything is just a waste.,2,"I fucking hate myself. I dislike literally everything about me. I’m ugly, looking somewhere between offensively plain and an amorphous blob. I’m lazy and have zero initiative. My blood relatives don’t speak to me because they know the truth of how much of a failure I am. Somehow I managed to get married to a wonderful guy,but I keep feeling like my relationship with his family is a sham and that as soon as they see the real me they’ll hate me. Pretty much the only family / safety net I have is his family, and I worry that if anything we’re to ever happen between him and I that I’d have literally nothing.

As shameful as this is, I even find myself jealous of him sometimes because he has parents and a family that loves him still. My parents are both dead. I know he’s not always had the best relationship with them, but I wish I had them too. I love his parents, and his family like me, but I still can’t see them as “parents” to me. I just feel fake, almost like someone playing a part.

I used to have a full time job,but got fired. I worked seven years in a low wage deadend part time job and when I finally left there I was making less than the people at the store across from me were making starting out.

I went to the hospital last year for a severe stomach ache but because I don’t have health insurance it ended up costing me around $8000. With a small discount from the hospital and some payments on parts of the bill it’s went down to $3500. Now I’m in collections for it. If I’d known it would have cost me that much I never would’ve went, because I can’t afford it. I’ve tried to talk with the hospital to get them to lower it but they refused.

I know now that I can’t afford to go to a hospital so I’ve told my husband to only take me to one if I’m unconscious and he can’t get me to wake up.

Every time the bill collectors call I get anxious and have a panic attack and I’m reminded that I don’t have health insurance and I am reminded of just how much of a failure I am. I need to call them to set up some form of plan, but the mere thought of that makes me nauseous. I don’t think I’m suicidal, but I honestly just wish that I’d pass away in my sleep sometimes. Oh, and all the motor mounts in my car are broken and all the electricity and it keeps flickering really low while I drive the cost to fix the motor mounts is about $1200.

Everyone in my life would cut me off if they found out I was gay,8,So the majority of my family are homophobic Christian’s and I live in a place where it’s normal to just hate gay people so there’s no one i can tell. My mom told me that if I ended up gay I would get kicked out immediately and my dad told me he would punch my teeth in if I was gay and I’m 16 so I have to live with them for two more years.The person I love most in my life my older brother also hates gay people. I feel like I have absolutely no one who would actually accept me and love me if they knew the truth. I’ve known I was gay since I was 14 and I’ve been depressed and suicidal since about the same time.

The more I look into the past the more I see,8,"The more I look into the past and more time passes I see more what I have been through and they were actually tough times for me at least. I didn’t get treated until I was 39kg which I was proud to be and sometimes still am and it was covid times. I really wanted to die but couldn’t do it myself and I guess I also wanted to punish myself for not being good enough. So I simply starved to death. But it has been nearly two years and when I look into the past I see that I have been this way mild or not for a while now. Seven years ago, I did anything else to help my mother clean the house, barely washed my teeth or showered, didn’t want to go outside but still did anyway, made studying my whole purpose of life. I was hardworking student until I started high school and Puf. It was all gone. I literally had to crawl on floor to study, I barely talked to people and started having self destructive thoughts. I thought that everyone hated me and it was because of how ugly I was, I was an outsider and didn’t deserve to talk to people. So I didn’t talk to people for five years. Didn’t have any friends or good memories. I also thought that people on the street were looking at me. And they were all judging me. Fast forward to uni, I started getting treatment but I was still unstable somewhere. I could talk to people now but I still have hard time starting or keeping the conversation going. I got a cat to help me cope with loneliness but during another moment of mine, I tried to pet it by force. He didn’t like it and bit me. We brawled and it was over but I started to hate it because it loved me only for food and our relationship wasn’t genuine. Of course this is not true and I can see that now, I also have many examples way worse than this but I’m not comfortable sharing. Anyway I started taking a new med and I’m fine now. I can see clearly the things I used to believe and I don’t have anymore fantasies of suicide but damn that was a long way to come. I feel very tired and fed up with it and just want to end. I feel weak even though I have been through more tough stuff.

Im doing all the right things but I am getting no where in my life. I don't think I'll be able to make it to the end of this week. I want to shoot myself. I feel like a burden to everyone in my life.

really struggling to cope with being underemployed.,1,"
(sorry i’m reposting this bc i accidentally posted it from a non anon account). 

i recently changed jobs because i was being sexually harassed at work. I thought my new job would be fine because I made very clear I needed 25 hours a week minimum to make ends meet, and my manager agreed to this. However, once I had started the job I was getting anywhere between 6 and 18 hours a week, which simply isn’t enough for me to get by. I brought this up to him and i was basically told ‘all the positions are filled’. I don’t think he’s trying to force me out because he’s told me after every shift that he’s really happy with my performance and I’m always early for shifts and offer to stay late if needed etc. 

For the last two weeks I have been frantically looking for new jobs (literally have applied for hundreds), I have applied for universal credit, I’ve even taken on two market stalls (i do art as a hobby so I sell my stuff at craft fairs sometimes) to raise funds for the month. I have three interviews in the next week. 

I know this situation isn’t my fault and I’m doing everything in my power to change it… but I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt, shame and embarrassment. I feel like it’s all my fault and that I’m stupid for having taken on this job and not having seen some magical invisible red flag.  I feel so ashamed of myself for not having a stable job or career (I’m 25 and the only thing I actively want to do as a career is tattooing but so far I’ve been met with nothing but rejection because it’s so competitive in my city). I’m so embarrassed and I feel like my family aren’t proud of me and I’m just some layabout waster choosing not to work when I know that’s not the case. 

I even worry that my partner is going to leave me because of my employment situation, despite the fact that they’ve shown no signs of thinking negatively of me or that it’s my fault. I don’t want to see any of my friends or family because I might just burst into tears or start ranting and not be able to stop so I’ll just push everyone away by being negative. I haven’t slept for days because I’m having nightmares (i have ptsd) which also flares up when stressed. just finished 3 years of therapy for it so idk how it would help doing any more) due to stress about money and I feel so ashamed of myself for having let this situation happen. 

I don’t want a family. I don’t care about owning property. I don’t care about expensive clothes or holidays or my fucking pension or anything like that. All I have ever wanted is to do tattooing (don’t care about money just want enough to live on) and having good solid relationships. I genuinely don’t care about the rest of it. I feel like I can’t do anything right and I can feel myself freezing and clamming up because I’m so afraid I’m going to have a nervous breakdown. Like I even have an exhibition coming up in July for LGBTQIA+ pride in my city and this will be really great exposure for me as a small artist, but I just go to my art studio and sit at my desk and want to cry. I’m trying so so hard to go through the motions and be productive and do self care and see people and everything but it’s just not working for me and I don’t know what to do. 

Everything feels so uncertain in my life right now and I really don’t know what to do. I’m scared I’m going to have to start using food banks and that kind of stuff soon. like I’m grateful to live in a country that has options like that but i’m just still panicking. i feel like because i’m in good health and able to work, it’s just wrong for me not to. idk sorry this is so messy i just needed to get this off my chest",13w44uy,Jaded-Pride-9846,1685485523.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13w44uy/really_struggling_to_cope_with_being_underemployed/,,Depression

I don't know if I want to get better anymore.,2,"Hi, so I'm 17m. I've been depressed (on and off + among other things) since I was 11. I'm not formally diagnosed but I'm 90% sure as I have been close to suicide, have self-harmed, etc.  


I'm from the UK and because of the options available to me, I would go to my GP to start getting mental health help. Because of my circumstances, this is going to have to happen during school holidays (either today tomorrow the day after or in about a month). I was fully prepared to do this and get up at 7:50am ready to call in and get my appointment, but I don't know if I can anymore.

&#x200B;

I was thinking about why I was so reluctant to get an appointment, so I started reading online at a few of the reasons why, and none of them seem to fit. But I think it's more that I've been depressed (and hated my body etc etc not relevant to this) for such a large portion of my life that I don't know if I'd be the same person if I weren't depressed. And I don't want to change.

Life does not get better RANT. Am I alone?,3,"❤️ If you read this, thank you ❤️

Well. Life still sucks. And today is so much worse. (24f)

I'm really tired of mulling over the fact that I feel so God awful in my head regardless of how good my external circumstances are. I feel worse mentally now than I did when I was actively being abused. No one has been able to explain why, and I hold a lot of resentment because of it. You go through some shit, and everyone around you says ""things will get better, stay strong"". Well guess what people, my circumstances did get better, and I'm just as suicidal if not more, so where does that leave me huh? I am so angry at the world, at myself. Even as I write this I don't know what to say because it's one of those days where EVERYTHING has come up and as a result I've been crying for hours. When I do get a break from crying I just dissociate because there's nothing I can do to move through this feeling. 

You know what's sad, is that a lot of my mornings, I wake up bombarded with suicidal and extremely depressive thoughts before I even get to open my eyes. Every minute of the day, from the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep, all I can think about is how deeply I do not want to be here. Even that is tricky though, because I would really like to live, I really really want to enjoy life and explore and grow and experience, but I can't. I feel like I have been doing everything I can to improve my life and myself, and I don't get anywhere. 

Everytime I say I'm a failure I'm met with people reminding me that I have created a good relationship and despite my upbringing I've lived on my own and went to college. To that I say that's fucking stupid, and I'm tired of hearing it. My only achievement in life has been surviving. I have a good relationship now because I nearly didn't survive my last one. I live on my own because I barely survived with my family. I went to college because I barely survived highschool and have been made to believe college is the only option for a good life. My ONLY achievements have been survival, and that fact does not make me feel any better whatsoever. My previous therapist would always remind me ""you just came out of a war"".... Of CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM STILL IN THE WAR, EXCEPT I DON'T HAVE A GOOD REASON TO BE NOW. 

I am fucking exhausted all of the time, and every single day I try to do what I can to get better, and everyday I'm just further depressed by the fact that I feel too tired to do the work, and I don't have enough time, and having to choose doing one thing means another can't get done. Let me explain, in the morning I'll wake up and think of my to do list, all of which are immediately followed by guilt already. 1. I need to go to work (but extra stress because I've been working partime hours for 6 months when I need fulltime. I'm not working fulltime because I just can't, I've done everything I can to work more, and in 6 months I have not improved in the slightest. Every single job I've ever had in my life I've had to quit because my attendance was so bad. I know my spouse is disappointed and worried about my lack of working hours, as they have told me this is concerning for our future.) 2. I need to do house chores (spouse is working twice as much as I am and has still done more housework than me. If I can't work I should be able to keep up with housework, but I cant for the same reason I can't do anything else, and I don't know what that reason is.) 3. I need to do something towards building a career (because spouse told me if we ever want a future together I need to start thinking about a career, but I don't have any ambition or interest so I have to force myself to learn and hope that interest comes later. I've been waiting on passion since I was in middle school and it never came. I also dropped out of college and now I have 20k in debt that got me absolutely nowhere in life.) 4. I need to shower and brush my teeth and hair (but I often dread doing these things due to depression and frequently forget to do them because of adhd which leaves me feeling disgusting.) 5. I need to eat multiple times a day (ADHD means I have a lot of problems with food and add in depression I have no desire, energy or residual stress tolerance to prepare, cook, eat, and clean something that is nutritious) 6. I need to connect with my spouse whether it be hanging out or having sex (but this often falls last in my to do list because everything else has more immediate importance, and by the time I'm done everything else I have no extra time or energy, especially for sex. But not doing so dampens our relationship and affects them negatively too). Plus whatever fucking else pops up in the day that I need to deal with. 

What I've just written out is why I feel like I'm doomed. I don't have the time or energy to do it all. And I know I don't need to do it all at once, but all of those things listed are necessities, with the exception of career planning. I can't skip work, I can't skip hygiene, I can't skip eating, and if I do they have severe consequences. I can skip time with spouse, but that has consequences that don't just affect me. And I could skip career stuff but that just puts me right back where I was before spouse mentioned my directionless life. Could I do it on and off? In theory yes, in actuality no. Why? Because I fall out of habit easily and can't remember anything. If I'm forcing myself to do something I need momentum, and that stops when you do. 

Basically I'm just screwed regardless, so everyday I feel all This stress, and I get done maybe a third of what I'm supposed to because I'm too mentally exhausted from just being conscious, and by the end of the day I'm reminded of how much of a failure I am. Even when I feel good in a day, by the end of the week and self reflect and realise I actually didn't get anywhere, but I feel like I did the work. At the end of the month, year, decade, it's all the same. I survived because I had to, I changed some things in life because I absolutely had to. Now that Im not receiving abuse in all directions, I don't need to work to survive, I need to work to improve. I have worked to improve, but I have seen 0 results. That's not even an exaggeration, I've genuinely seen no improvement in years. 

So when I wake up, and all of these things flood my mind, all I can think of after that is visual images of me killing myself. I walk into the kitchen and I look out the window and I see myself hanging. I go to the bathroom, look at the tub, and see myself drowning. I grab a Band-Aid, I see the pills, and in my head I'm laying on the floor foaming at the mouth. I grab the scissors, I see the knifes, and i imagine blood everywhere. Spouse may see me zoned out, but what I see is 7 different ways I could die in the next hour. I see myself writing notes and the receivers reading them. I see spouse coming home from work to find me dead, I see the medics and police retrieving my body. And then I remember regardless of how much I don't want to he here, leaving isn't an option because I hurt the people who love me. And that thought isn't comforting, it makes me feel trapped. So I sit and a fantasize about not being alive. I feel immense relief when I see myself hanging over the balcony, pedestrians calling 911, and the firemen coming to get me. I'm not in control anymore. I move my body, I choose what to say, but I am not me, the feelings the death the pain, it feels like I've been possessed, and the real me is screaming and begging to be in control again, but I'm not, my life is not my own. I'm not a person, I'm a walking depression poster. 

Tldr - my life is great and yet Im more suicidal than ever. Life did get better, and I did not, and Ill end up dragging everything down with me. I feel like I'm putting in so much effort to improve, and i have absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm out of options, I just float now wishing I was dead.

Feel shitty for not working enough,3,"My workplace is kind of in a weird position right now, so the schedule is basically ""Come in when you want, leave when you want"" until further notice. I genuinely just can't muster up the energy to go for more than four or five hours each day. After that the mental haze of constant obsession over memories and depressive self talk/suicidal ideation gets too overwhelming. Then I come home and hate myself for not working the extra two or three hours and start stressing about how I'll never have enough money to make it through college. Worst part is, I know I haven't even got it that bad. Other people have graduated debt free from college in worse circumstances than mine, other people have handled worse bouts of depression with more grace than I'm handling mine, other people can work three jobs and still hold their lives together. I'm probably only working like 20-25 hours a week at the moment and I still don't work out, I still have no friends, and I still can't do anything beyond ""acceptable"" in any other area of my life. I should be stronger than this. I was stronger than this, for most of my existence before now. My parents already resent me for not being more than I am, as they've made clear to me many times. Every day I become more and more convinced that I have no future. How could I have one, if this is the upper limit of my ability to work or push through hard things? Suicide constantly occupies my thoughts-- literally the only thing I have left to go on is the fact that a couple of my relatives rely on me for emotional support sometimes, and I feel like it would be my fault if my suicide drove them to kill themselves. I'm not sure I can handle the guilt of destroying people who are so much more worthwhile than I am because I allowed my welfare to take priority over theirs. But I can't do this for the rest of my life.

Sometimes if you shut your eyes and turn on some white noise, you can pretend you're not even on this planet anymore. You can remember a time your body didn't exist. It's warm and nice. It's dark.

"It's okay, you are not alone",0,"It's oky
To not feel oky
When you can't find the words
When you don't know what to say
When you feel you fighting worlds 
When everything seems to go wrong
When things are harder than they should 
No matter how hard you try 
The outcome seems to be the same
When you do everything you could 
It's not your fault, you ain't to blame 


Take a deep breath
You are not alone

And i know, you are tired of this pain
Tired of the ""you have to fight""
But this is not in vain
And everything can be alright

Maybe no one knows how you feel...

And I know...The demon is real
But it's not under your bed
It whispers in your ear
Always in your head
Always in your chest
Filling you with fear
Night over night without rest 

Is hard to keep up, i know
But don't give up
Life is more than it seems to show
Don't chose to go
There are many reasons to stay

Close your eyes
Keep those demons at bay
All those voices are lies
They whispered at my ear too
I felt the tightning of the rope...
But it's still possible
So don't lose your hope

I know, that ""head up"" is hard to keep
Nights awake
And days whishing you were asleep
Feelings that are hard to shake 
Floor feel like quicksand 
No one seems to see
No one seems to understand 
How all hurts, deep to the bone 

But believe me
Please, make your stand 
Grab your phone
There are someone willing to hold your hand

I'm 29 and I feel like my life is over.,2,"Hi.

I'm 29 years old. I'm not a teen anymore, but I feel old as fuck. I have a good job, I have a house, I'm probably in the best physical form I've ever been... and yet I feel alone and aimless.

I used to have so many projects and dreams, but now I feel like there is nothing left for me in life, nothing that will excite me and get me out of bed in the mornings.

My social life has been dwindling so slowly that I have barely noticed. Most of it was my friends, but in the last year they have begun to move away, get married, get children... This is only going to get worse.

Things might be a little better if I had a girlfriend to build a life with, like many of my friends do, but I have never had a relationship, and trying to get into one at this age seems daunting. I've thought about Tinder, but the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach.

And worst of all is that even though I know I feel like this because of loneliness I don't even believe I would feel otherwise if I were to solve that problem. If I was still meeting my friends every weekend or if I had a girlfriend I would still feel like my life amounts to nothing.

I was pretty ok with my life two months ago, and suddenly I spend half my day thinking about suicide. What is wrong with me?

Anyway.

Over everything else I have a shitty personality I'm not sociable as I used to, I'm not nice, I'm not helpful... 

Her sort of partner ended up helping me to immigrate and I tried to be nice and have a agreeable relationship but he acts like an idiot in though times and since then I avoided him.
He asked for forgiveness and I said it's ok... but i feel so uncomfortable with him.
My mother and my father had a ugly divorce and I can't seem to accept any other person. This trauma makes me act up with him and I try to avoid him because I cannot say what I think honestly to his face.
But my mother is just right i should be grateful. I feel like and awful person because i just can't and it's the same with other people... I don't like them so I avoid them because when I'm with them in my head all this mean shit pops up...
I'm just a bitch i think. I just wanna live an easy life but I guess that's over for me.

Depressed bf pushed me away,20,"My bf suffers from depression. We had a wonderful long term relationship before he started having personal and financial issues. Then he started acting weird around me, he would avoid hanging out or being physical with me. He did express his feelings to me, he said he felt like he was in a dark hole, that he felt empty inside and I told him I would be there for him no matter what, he said he didn't want to bring me/our relationship down with him, that I didn't deserve that, and our relationship didn't deserve that either because he was aware that he was not doing things right. He would still make an effort be there for me, to be kind and loving and I kept being there for him as well supporting him but sometimes the rejection would break my heart. He would only act ""normal"" when he was drinking and it was weird because he would treat me right and then he would act indifferent.

He could act normal around his friends and other people but me, he said he was tired of that because he felt like he was wearing a mask and that he couldn't that with me, he couldn't pretend or be fake around me because I know him too well and I matter to him. Until one day he told me he couldn't handle it anymore and he asked me for time and space for him to sort his stuff out, he said he didn't know how long it would take him but that he does want to get better for him and for the both of us. It was very sad for me because we had never been apart for more than 2 weeks, but I do want him to get better. Now it's weird, It's been two months and I have just texted him to check in once every 2 weeks to ask how he's doing and he's always very cold like he has no intention of starting a conversation or seeing me, I guess he is just not ready yet. I miss him and love him so much and I understand this break is for the best so the relationship doesn't get damaged.

I just wonder if he misses me or thinks about me the same way I do. Has anybody been in a similar situation? Did you miss the person you pushed away or think about them? Why is it hard for them to talk or see the person they pushed away?",13vx5j9,notaserialkillerrr,1685469350.0,15,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vx5j9/depressed_bf_pushed_me_away/,,Depression
What to do?????,2,"I'm 26 female and have been with my Highschool sweetheart for more than 10 years now. 7 years back I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe anxiety disorder, life has been very difficult after that. I have been on medication and therapy since then. My boyfriend is 25 and we have been in a long distance relationship. 
We both wished to get married before 2026 and everything seemed fine. Lately, I made the decision that I wish to stay in State A because I enjoy the climate here and property prices aren't that high and I would be able to own an independent home with a small garden area. I'm an introvert. He is an extrovert, he said that there is no way he is ever coming to State A and would prefer to end the relationship, and move on with someone else (even if it is an arranged marriage by his parents). 
I told him that he will have good career opportunities in this part of the country as well but he blatantly said 'no'. 
I discussed this with my mother, she said that if he is not ready to understand why having an open spaced home is necessary for you instead of living in apartments/flats then he is not the right person for you. 
He said that I will build a similar home for you but give me 10 or 15 years, but I already have the option of a home.Why should I waste these many years cramped? 
I know I can't expect him to move here but how can he expect me to move to different cities in a few years. I tried explaining why this arrangement is beneficial for my mental health and this will provide me with an order which I crave. 
I attempted suicide last week, things were horrible. I sat down with my parents and therapist, came up with the plan to have my own space which I would be in complete control of. 
The thought of it brings peace to me. 
I thought he would understand but he is trying his best to end things and not even giving it a thought.",13vx46h,haryyp,1685469262.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vx46h/what_to_do/,,Depression
I can't find a reason to live. Help.,2,"Like the title says, i can't find a reason to live. I must say i'm probably lucky and have better condition then many people but i'm suicidal. I'm saying this because i see people living in streets, i know people who lost their families and yet they still living. I got things those people don't have but they have a stronger will then i have.

I don't know what to do. I don't leave my house if it is not necessary. I lost all my friends because i rejected to hang out with them so many times. I lost my interest in all my hobies. I became a masturbation addict because it's like a drug, it numbs my brain and it keeps me away from girls. Lucky i don't drink or use drugs. 

My parents are emotionally disabled i think. They support me at all matters except emotions and stuff. I talk with them every week but they never ask me how i'm really doing. We never talk that stuff inside our family. So i have not even one soul to ask me how i'm really doing. 

What should i do? Since i don't have any one to talk about these stuff i'm asking you guys? How do you handle, how should i handle? Because i don't really want to end it.

the scariest moment of my depression experience.,1,"My depression has been eating at me for years now. For the most part, things have been manageable with therapy and support but as of lately, I haven’t had either. Fast forward to yesterday morning, passive suicidal thoughts really started to push their way to the forefront of my mind. As I made my way to the bathroom I exchanged glances with myself in the mirror and there it was. Looking at myself with red swollen eyes, it was the look. The very look me and my dad exchanged the night before he attempted suicide in our home. I was 10 at the time so I didn’t really understand what he was going through. As I got older that moment really began to stand out to me. My dad was hurting, he was depressed and that night it became to much for him. Granted, his attempt was not successful.

IF I could just kill myself then everyone would know I didn't want to do it,1,"Alt account. I think I've lived my whole life unenthusiastic of doing anything really. I'm at a crossroads, I've been working on music for 5 years, and I kept a dayjob like I was asked to at my fathers. I worked for the rent to stay and then inflation hit. I then had to move back home to my mothers. from the very start, my whole room was full of a crazy ex-bfs stuff. I had to clean everything out myself, and the rest of the house still needs cleaning but I've given up on that. Eventually got a job here, and started making enough money to continue my hobby, even bought a better computer. I know I'm not the most disciplined but I work due-diligently through the nights and days cause I love doing this. 

the job I got was a PCA. Personal care assistant. the same job my mother has and I basically just had to watch this old man in his chair, get him smokes, make coffee etc. the real challenge is that he has no filter, and that filter is racist, sexist, and demented. He was like that toward all coworkers including my mother, and called me mogley because I look like it from the movie he says. it's been 7 months since I've had this job, it was going okay, but people keep quitting and then our boss wants to call us in to fill in the hours. 

I just called that person that quit. she was crying on the phone cause she didn't think I would care, but I asked her shy she quit, turns out she has a son same age as me and kept asking and ioking about his color toward her, and like I said, he was sexist also and I guess he kept poking her boob, and she was just really sad, she said to me ""you're name is not mogley, you have to quit too, he need to go to a f***ckin nursing home. I tried to care about him but he doesn't deserve anyone, and I shouldn't tell you this thai, but he says awful things about your mom too"" 

I told her, thank you and maybe I'll try to soon, but it felt I was smarter than her in conversation so I just agreed and made sure I appreciated her concern. I guess when I say smarter, I guess I've always felt cynical of people. I raised my concerns toward my mother though about how we keep losing people, and being called in for extra days that are not scheduled, I told her we should quit and find different jobs, but of course, now she starts suggestingntrade schools, or working the mines for something yadayada. 

I just, I'm tired. I'm tired of caring, because I don't really care about my mom after a certain moment. I don't care to work. I don't want really anything. why does it feel so hard to not feel like I'm being manipulated into something. I felt just fine working any dumb job to continue my hobby and make that into a living. I wish sometimes I could just kill myself and then they would know I didn't want to do any of this. I didn't care about any of this, I don't feel anything. this house could burn, my mother could leave, and it wouldn't phase me. I'm shut off inside. I'm not super depressed, I can still walk around, and I'm not sociopathic as I care plenty about music and the music producer friends I've made but, I'm just. I don't care, and finding another job that pays the same is not going to be easy.

And i study from home. I am getting a degree in something i am passionate in! But that heaviness never seems to leave. my friends are all studying at physical universities and i am an online student with an overseas university. 

I tend to isolate when i'm sad and i think this has pushed so many of my friends away.

For the past three months I’ve had this constant slight numbness that runs on my left side from head to to which stops right at my spine and occasionally back and muscle pains and cramps. I haven’t had any other symptoms other than that. The numbness has improved somewhat in the past three months but whenever I think about it seems to get worse.

I’m a normally very stressed and anxious person and it is true that I don’t exercise enough, besides I do lead a sedentary lifestyle.

"Needing help/advice, for my spouse who suffers from severe depression.",0,"Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this, and I apologize if it's rather lengthy. My spouse has been battling depression all her life, and did not grow up with very supportive parents. For a little backstory, her mother is extremely religious, as well as has very obvious mental disorders of her own. She's always been hard on my wife growing up, and never really provided any type of love or emotional support, but rather constantly shoving Jesus down her throat all the time.  

Her father, was always working, and never really there, so she never really had any love or support from anyone growing up at all. In short,  she's an atheist, who absolutely abhors religion, and I cant say I  blame her. She and I have been together for well over a decade, and sad to say, I have not been the best emotional support for her either, due to the fact I myself am autistic,  and struggle with my own issues as such.


She's been on all kinds of medication, from antidepressants to benzos, and nothing has ever really helped her more than it did harm. She's constantly battling ups and downs of depression,  suicidal ideation, is not currently on any medication,  and we don't have adequate health insurance to cover any kind of treatment. 

At the moment she is overwhelmed, as such, has described to me that shes felt completely disassociated from reality, and doesn't have the ability to feel anything,  just completely numb for the last 2 months. I've been searching for ways to help her and get her the proper help, we were thinking about going the holistic route, since traditional therapy and pharmaceutical medicine, has never been much of any help in our experience., but perhaps on a sliding scale.

One of the things I'm concerned with, is that she told me that she feels like she wouldn't be able to be completely honest with a therapist, without being admitted into a hospital.  This has already happened to her once in the past, where she had a mental break down, and her parents admitted her into a hospital for some length of time for suicidal ideation. 

I expressed to her the need to be completely honest, to receive the right help, and she says that if she told the therapist everything,  her suicidal ideation,  her plans and methods for killing herself,  she would be admitted, and we wouldn't be able to work or pay bills because of it.  Which, obviously in my eyes, that all comes 2nd to her being able to recieve help, yet she refuses.

Right now, she says she's fine,  as long as she doesn't feel like she's alone in having to deal with everything ie bills, responsibilities,  that her suicidal ideation is kept at bay, despite the fact shes constantly disassociated and numb all the time. 

Unfortunately,  due to my job and responsibilities,  I can't always be there with her at home,  and there are days when she's home alone off from work. One of my greatest fears, is coming home one day, and finding that shes killed herself,  and I would not be able to live with myself were that to God forbid ever happen. Thats a fear I've been battling myself, all the years I've been with her. 

I don't honestly know what to do in this situation,  I'm trying to find her affordable help, and asking people for advice,  and just simply be there for her as much as I can, but I don't know what else to do, I feel powerless. I'm Buddhist,  and have tried to invite her to the temple to be in a peaceful setting and around good people, but as I said, she hates religion, and she also has severe social anxiety, and is therefore not open to it.

Any help, or advice you're able to give is much appreciated,  and needed. If you guys know any kind of good sliding scale doctor or treatment, or certain methods that I can use to help her etc. Any kind of information you guys can provide will be much appreciated.

Today has been the worst, I work from home and all I want to do is lay on my couch and sleep. I barely have any energy and I feel like crying about little things, just general over sensitivity.

Why does it feel like I have to jump through hoops for treatment,1,"It feels like they want me to prove my worth for treatment by seeing if I can do the Labors of Heracles. I fought through so much anxiety to even call for an appointment, and then I was told I had to call another number for a phone intake. After I called the second number, they told me I needed to go to a walk-in intake where it was first come, first served to see if I needed treatment. 

I missed that in-person thing today, which is okay because there's another on Thursday. Why can't I call and get an appointment? Even if I'm inactive in the treatment center’s system, I am a former patient. Can they not see some file that says “severely depressed bitch. Probably a little crazy. She needs help.” 

My best friend is going to be pissed. He doesn't understand how exhausting it is to make all these calls and go all these places. I don't want to expend the energy because I've been in and out of treatment for my depression for years, and nothing helps. I am out here throwing hail mary passes, trying to get out of this funk. I don't want to be depressed anymore. But depression wants to keep me. 

I know that I will have to go through even more shit to receive the treatment I want, spravato, even when a doctor told me my depression was treatment resistant and gave me a list with things like spravato and TMS.

"i've been depressed the past year, but i've never felt the same type of sadness i do as now",1,"okay so backstory.

i've always hated the way i look, especially been stressing about my weight. i'm asian and i used to get mocked/be a joke in middle school for the way i looked. ever since, i've dealt with an ed and just really cared about my appearence. i went from restricting really badly to now emotional binge eating. and as a person who's happiness really relies on the way i look, i hate myself so so much ever since i've gained sm weight. not only bc of the way i look, but also the fact that I am the one who's crying about being fat yet not doing anything about it. 

anyway, back then i used to feel pretty empty and just really really ""bored"" (?) and have ups and down with my self image. but i never really felt so ""sad"", more depressed if yk what i mean. i was also at least able to distract myself and have moments of happiness. last week tho something just altered me and i had this biggest breakdown where i was crying for hours. it kinda felt like my inner self just released everything i've been feeling for the past year (whatever the reason is). ever since that breakdown i haven't felt this depressed and suicidal as i ever have. i even started cutting myself again really badly. i cry ALL day. one negative thought is all it takes for me to bawl my eyes out. and not to mention the amount of hatred i have for me is insane. and when i cry it's like i'm crying about EVERYTHING. my weight, my eating, my personality, things i have done in the past that i regret, how i have no friends etc. and ofc all this have led me to emotional eating almost everyday which obviously doesn't help with the way i'm feeling.

I’m struggling with the idea of people,5,"People can tell me that not all people are bad and that there are some amazing ones out there, which I’m sure there are. But as someone who was f-d up by their entire family - from a violent father who may have had something to do with my mothers death (she was my best friend) to an indifferent brother, paternal grandparents that supported their son at all costs, friends that have used me and burned me, etc. I’m reluctant to ever try to be social again. Everytime I go outside, I try to keep a positive attitude only for people to almost veer off the road to hit me when I’m trying to rescue a beaver (I was way out of the road and not in it in any way). I just can’t do it and it’s not like I could find friends who feel the same because they are probably just as down and reclusive as I’ve become. Even going to a thrift store made me so so sad. Seeing all these things from the ‘80’s and ‘90’s that have been marked up way beyond the cost anyone originally bought them for (there was literally a chair for $6,000). It made me sad realizing the grandparents on my mothers side and their friends would have just been happy to see this stuff in a new home and loved and now it’s just sitting there in a thrift store for profit. Any glimpse into positivity gets ruined by people. Animals are great but there’s no way to truly escape society and I can’t be that remote anyway with all the doctors and therapy appointments I go to.

I found out about misanthropy this weekend, but surprise, all libraries I’ve been to don’t have a single book on it - not even the digital libraries I’m subscribed to - so it’s like they don’t want you to know.

I just can’t cope adjusting to the thought of society or even just people. They’re so cruel and evil and selfish. All I can feel and see is the pain that they bring and I don’t think I’m cut out for this. I don’t know what to do for anything to be better. I’ve been trying to engage in walking (which is good in the early morning when people aren’t out) but I feel fundamentally broken and dysfunctional.

The only thing in my head are constant screams saying to kill myself and that if I can't even do that then why should I try anymore. I don't know what to do anymore everybody around me expects more they want me to do more while they sit back and relax.

I haven't meet that person or at least I haven't tried enough for that person they want me to be the best I can be and I wanna be it for them but maybe this is the best I will be maybe I can't be the person they want me to be.

Help me out PLEASE,1,"Hello everyone, I am a 22 year old Bulgarian who went to study his Bachelor of Data Science and AI in the Netherlands.

When I came here I was 19 yo and I was happy with my life - I was going out a lot, being social, gym 5 times a week, go to clubs, in short I was enjoying life a lot. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE NETHERLANDS everything in my head changed. 

At first, I had no friends in NL, so I was alone with my thoughts most of the time. I started to think about life a lot in a very deep way searching for its meaning. Before I have never done this since I was always distracted from thinking deep because of my dynamic life back in Bulgaria. This is when my depression started. Everything seems more and more pointless the more I think it as time goes on. Do a family? Why? Whats the point? That's what nature wants from me fk it. Fuck girls? Why? Pleasure seeking? Get a carrier? So what? Work hard and just die and noone remembers you.

Nowadays its hard for me to even brush my teeth in the morning ( What is the point of brushing them? Get cavity? So what? Who cares? Nothing matters). There are just so many contradictions in my head that I can barely be present. Sometimes I get bursts of motivation that I am going to do something with my life but this lasts a few hours at most. I feel so hopeless ngl. I even struggle to go shower.

Yes, I know all the people that give you rational answers like bla bla just study do ur stuff workout blabla everything is gonna be ok. These are stupid answers for me. Sometimes when I go to uni Im like: ""Why do I even care about these grades.. and going to this building every day.. we are just fking ape on a spinning rock, nothing matters.. even if you build something big in ur life its goona be forgotten and destroyed with time or if y have stupid kids ( which you don't have much control over as well)""

I believe that in order to be successful I need to have a strong philosophy for life and something that drives me towards my goals so I can surpass every obstacle on the way. Its all in the head. I see some people adopt the view of believing in God but that is a dellusion for me. People just need something to believe to in order to be motivated. But still a dellussion.. I cannot trick myself into this even when sometimes I try to adopt some kind of a productive belief system.

&#x200B;

What to do??? At first I was like this is just a period of my life its normal... but it still hasn't gone away..

I am open for all suggestions you have.... I was even thinking to end my life a few times.... the only thing that stopped my was that I am going to make my parents suffer..

Oh yeah, and my parents who have very high expectations for me and ask me every day how is uni going like uni is the only important thing in this fking crazy world... EVERYTHING IS POINTLESS.

I'm tired of not knowing if I'm okay or not,2,"I don't think I have depression but I don't know where else to write. I'm hoping this might clear my head for a minute. I'll just write this as I'm going so this will probably get confusing.

I feel bad right now but I can't describe it. It's like my mind can't stop thinking about if I'm okay or not. I feel like I want to just be left alone and forgotten. I wish nobody cared about me so I could just stay in bed. But yesterday I was feeling fine, shopping with my sister like nothing was ever going on.

I function like a normal human being. I wake up, brush my teeth, go to school and shower feeling normal. But when I sometimes stay still and lay in my bed those bad feelings come right back. It feels like I ""remind"" myself that I'm not okay. I know it sounds bad that's what it feels like. I'm afraid I'm just making everything up and faking everything. I tried to think of a reason why I would fake feeling like this but I don't know. I kind of wish I was depressed, but I don't know if that's because I want clarity or what the fuck.

One day I feel completely normal, the next day I feel bad. I can't explain that ""bad"" feeling it's just... bad. 

I want to harm myself too, but it's always superficial and never leaves a permanent mark. After I've hurt myself I feel so quilty for not being able to hurt mysemf worse.

"Everything has fallen apart around me, but I'm getting help",1,"I've been struggling with feelings of dread since I was in middle school. I've always been good in school, pretty smart. I know I'm not a terrible person but no matter what I do, I feel like I'm nothing or unloved. I've been starved for affection since I was a kid. My mom left, never knew my dad. Raised by my grandparents, who were never that affectionate. I know they love me but I've spent most of my time growing up alone in my basement room. On the computer or playing Xbox. Whatever I decided. My mom finally comes back in to my life around 13 years old and she has crazy drug problems. I was going through her house a year later after she was arrested for manufacturing meth. The place sickened me. Counterfeit money, needles, weird sex stuff everywhere. I think that scarred me more than anything else. I don't know. But I've had issues with relationships. I feel inadequate. I feel starved in them. Fast forward to 4 years ago. I met someone that has been incredible to me. And I've done nothing but breach trust. I've looked at other women, talked to women. When looking, it was pornographic material. When talking, it was typical conversation and never sexual in any means. I just liked the attention and I think it's due to me lacking it growing up. I've struggled with depression this whole time I was with her and I never got help. I was afraid of being broken. And that spiraled me in to making those poor choices and breaching trust. I wish I could take it back. I love her so much. Now she is leaving me. And I dunno if there's any chance of getting her back. I'm at my lowest. But now that I'm there, I've reached out to family that never knew I had depression issues and feelings of dread. I'm going to see a specialist and finally get help.

Why do I have such sudden moodswings?,2,"I'm a man, 22yo. What annoys me the most is that I make a big effort to be supportive to people and be kind and humble. I clean the house and try to understand others. I always listen and let others finish. But people often use my kindness and walk over me. I get easily stressed over the smallest things at work or in person. I often feel alone, but when someone tries to talk with me I get a feeling I can't explain. It's ""Please leave me alone, but also keep talking"". I often mainly focus on what my face does, am I making eye contact too much etc and I often completely miss what the person is saying to me.

I don't know how to explain my other feelings. But it's one moment I feel really down, empty and disconnected from people. I avoid talking and socializing because I have the feeling I'm all alone and nobody gets me. Then an hour later I suddenly get a feeling that resembles happiness, for literally no reason at all. It's something I actually feel happening, like something is being injected that makes me happy.

And then I suddenly talk more to co-workers and I'm more social and open. Then the same day I can drop into the empty feeling and feel like I'm all alone again. I never cry or talk about my emotions. And ""the bro's"" don't tend to react well when you get emotional anyway. I even sat down and listened to the saddest music possible thinking about the saddest things, but all I got was that empty feeling that makes my stomach ache.

I don't have many friends and I don't have a relationship (Which I sometimes struggle with mainly due to social pressure). I am probably demisexual anyway so I often feel disconnected when people talk about the sexual stuff.  I just don't know why I have this so much. One moment I'm super happy that people talk to me or that I'm invited to play some party games. The next moment I say ""I'm busy"" and go listen to music in my bed and avoid talking to people.

I self-sabotage this way a lot, and have ruined at least 2 potential relationships with women. I don't get many compliments from women but when I do it's always ""You're cute"".

"I ran away, I don't know what to do now",2,"
Throwaway because friends at my school know my main account.


I gotta get something off my chest because it's eating me alive. I'm just 16 stuck in this messed up house with abusive parents from hell. They treat me like garbage, and when I finally gather the guts to report them, the fucking police didn't do anything. Like, seriously, what the actual hell?

I poured my heart out, spilling every painful detail, hoping they would hear me, see me, and actually care. They even had the nerve to tell me they will detain me if I falsely called them over again. 

Its because my parents are upstanding citizens. Posts like this usually include drunks, poverty or crackhead parents. But nope, my dad is a lawyer and my mom is just pretty middle-aged woman. 

When I come back home from school, I have to endure psychological torture from her every day. Even being on my phone for more than 5 minutes she would start to insult and degrade me despite me having perfect grades.

My dad is much worse, first of all, he cheats on my mom a lot. And the stress from clients and his mistress makes him take it all out on me. Whenever I am sitting or anything he would come behind me and slap me asking why am I not studying or working on something that will make me rich. I am in school ffs! There are days where he would get very violent and choke and slap me. But I guess somewhere in his mind he always knew I would report them and was careful to not leave any bruses on me.

Only one in my household who I could find relief with was our maid. She would cook for me and help me with my chores. They did the same to her but she would endure it like me, she is a migrant.

Every night, I'm drowning in my own tears, crying myself to sleep because life's a never ending nightmare. The abuse just keeps coming like a vicious cycle that won't quit. And when I turned to the police for help, they did nothing.

Since yesterday, I decided to run away. And no, I won't be going to social support or child services. If I already reported them to the police and they didn't do anything, I doubt other services would too.

Currently staying at my friend's place. I can't believe how many people pretend to care but when I am at my lowest, no one was here. If it wasn't for her I would be on the streets now. And no, they didn't report me to the police. I already called my aunt and she knows everything. She'll be in town in a week and hopefully I can move in with her. She even wanted to sent me some cash because I don't have any but doesn't know how because she doesn't even know how to use paypal.

My friend was more than helpful, if she decides to let me be at her place even for two more days I would be more than lucky.

Only problem is, I don't know what to do until my aunt comes. My friend already has a big family and I am burden as I am already, they can't feed another mouth. 

I have this guy friend who is 25 that would help me and my friends get weed before. Apart from getting weed, we usually had no other interactions. He seems creepy but to be honest, I'm just tired and desperate right now. I'm thinking of taking his offer and see what he has in mind.

What should I do?

Also, I'll keep you all updated on what's going on.

I can’t bare one more day at my job,1,"I work on an assembly line, right now 9 hrs 5 days for 45 hr weeks. When I started we could listen to our own music and podcasts etc. but they made a rule against it after management saw some idiots standing around watching Netflix at the line.

"I feel so stuck, everything is passing by without me.",1,"I’ve been having this extremely empty and boring feeling lately. Everyday is the same, everyday I do the exact same thing. 

I get out of bed, go to work, come home, wait for my gf to arrive, eat dinner, do dishes, and sit down for the rest for the night because I’ve been rushing all day. I can’t seem to catch a break out of this mondain routine I’ve been sent into. Even on the weekends, I feel like this is going on. Can’t do shit, because chores. 

I’ve bought a car, and most of the time I can’t even use that, because my gf needs it for work or other things, and I’m Stuck at home again. I’ve tried to get her to buy her own car but she “doesn’t have the funds right now”, neither did I really but I managed to buy a decent car anyway. 

All this just makes me feel so incredibly stuck. I just feel trapped. I want to better myself, teach myself, go out more, but I can’t because I feel like there is no time nor space in my head to do such things. And even when there is, I’m stuck at home because my car is gone for the day.

How can I stop crying?,1,"I, 39 F, have been dealing with episodes of depression for over 20 yrs. It got much worse the past 2 yrs which is when I finally sought out help, I got on antidepressants and started therapy. 6 months ago I moved to a different country and only started working a month ago. Psychiatry and therapy are very expensive here, and my insurance doesn’t cover them so I had to stop antidepressants 3 months ago but I was able to find a therapist I can afford. We’ve only had two sessions so far. 
My current issue: I’m in a new place, alone, and although I’m good at my job, the system is very different and takes some getting used to. Almost every day there’s one thing or another that triggers an anxiety attack, which I can manage when alone, but if anyone talks to me during, I often can’t help crying. I don’t want to be the new whiny girl crying at work everyday.
Does anyone here have any advice, techniques, coping mechanism that I can use to not cry every time I’m triggered?",13vptq6,Frankie0-0,1685451982.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vptq6/how_can_i_stop_crying/,,Depression

After hurting myself my therapist just tells me to use my support system and that’s the end of it.,5,"
Tw


What support system? My parents? No. Why the fuck would I confide in them. Here’s some shit they’ve said to me after finding out I cut. 

“We just need to get you off those pills. They’re messing your brain up.” (Referring to my depression pills) 

“Cutting won’t do anything. Grow up.” 

“Stop playing the victim.” 

“All kids have anxiety. You just need to get used to it.” 

“She’s right. You do have a victim mentality.” 

“You just need to exercise and eat healthier.” 

My family doesn’t understand anything. I’m on my third therapist now. My first one let me go after I tried to overdose. My second one wouldn’t tell me my diagnoses. No matter how much I asked. And now I’m on my third one who I’ve only seen once. And I don’t even remember therapy sessions because my memory is so fucked up from ptsd. And then I got a second opinion from a different psychiatrist saying I may not even have ptsd, just “some trauma.” I don’t know what to do. I hate therapy. My parents pay for it so when I don’t get better they say I’m not trying. 

I’m so tired of it. I’ve been in therapy for 6 years. When the fuck will it get better? Because I sure as hell can’t afford this once I move out. Actually I won’t even try. I probably won’t be able to pay for my meds either. My dad will be happy about that. That I’ll finally get off my meds.

"Cant seem to get out of this depressive Episode, 8+ months in",1,"Hey all,

First of all sorry for my english, its not my First language.
Since my GF of over 6 years has suprisingly left me and had an affair with someone she met on her holiday 1 before leaving me and she flew back there 2 weeks after leaving. That was 8 minths ago.
I am going through a depressive Episode which sometimes feels like i cant handle it.
I was madly in love with her, i wanted to propose to her this year, we were planing on having Kids soon. I was in love so much, that I Kind of lost myself - i was emotionally ddependent on her, and gave up a lot of myself to keep her, I have low self esteem and the relationship gave me this missing self esteem - such a beautiful girl and shes with me, i must be a good and admireable guy.

Then she left me out of the blue and started an affair. I had to get a New flat asap, my New job startet 2 werks after the breakup.

So i had to be focused on my New job (which i still cant, i feel like the job is not suiting me) i had to get used to live on my own, i have to live with the constant thought of the betrayal and the pain, and i have to figure out what it is in life, now that im ""alone"".

All These Things together make it really hard for me to find a way out of this i often do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am visiting a therapist, i dont know if its helping.

I dont enjoy my job but i have to get money.
I have to Service and move on and find a purpose, but i am So low on enegy still 
These have been the hardest 8 months of my life so far and i sometimes am not Sure if life is gonna get better again.
I do not want to live alone.
Sometimes i just wanna leave all behind but i am scared, i have Almosen no money and i am dependent on earning money every month. 
I am emotionally hurt and i cant stop thinking about the past, the betrayal and the pain, i still feel it physically. I want the security and the Plans for the future back.
I can hardly Look into the future optimistically.

List of reasons I wanted to stay alive practically gone within the last hour,1,"Not important, it's stupid. I'm just venting. Marked NSFW cause I dunno how this sub works in comparison to r/SuicideWatch that well.

Just some spring performance. Was actually excited cause it's the one time my parents give me an atom of responsibility. But suddenly there's school that day, meaning there's no way I'll be able to actually go out of school grounds unless a miracle happens. I was the only person who didn't know. Usually there is no classes so rehearsals can take place. But for some reason, the stupid teachers decided that there should be school There is no way I'll be able to do what I planned to do. There wasn't an announcement, I'm not on Instagram (nor are some people who 'kindly' told me that there is school), and yet somehow everyone at the school knew but me. The worst part abt this isn't even the fact my plans didn't work out. The performance is one of the most hectic days in the school year. Of course, it's also exam season, so I'm already stressed out. I don't even know at this point.

Exams are in 2 weeks. Haven't studied shit. 2 Stupid ass teacher for two of my classes decided to assign a project and an exam. **I CANT HANDLE 2 EXAMS AND 2 PROJECTS.** And then they wonder why my grades dropped. The teacher I actually liked can't stand me, and I'm already dealing with a teacher who can't teach shit. I'm definitely going to fail gym class cause half the time I had no energy to participate. And I'm just overwhelmed abt how this would all go.

Also at this point I feel like the one club I enjoy became another 'elite' club. Before it was fun, but now it's just tiring. The heads of the club are probably the worst people to lead this club. Entitled and everything. They take all the jobs yet the wonder why no one else is helping them. I mean we would help if WE KNOW THERES' JOBS IN THE FIRST PLACE. Fuck, I don't know how they run some of the events they do, even though I put myself out there to learn. Yet some kid in a younger grade already knows how to do \*everything\*. At this point, I don't want to apply to join for next year, not like I'll get in. 

The only friend I trusted with my feelings just straight up became an asshole. They still talk to me abt their mental problems, but they purposely avoid talking abt mine since I ended up in the hospital for an attempt. Yet they still pretend to care when I told them abt my performance day plans (same ones I mentioned before) cause of 'trauma' from when I went to the ward. They're trying to get me not to go. Yet they never realized that *it was the only reason I stayed alive*. They said they wanted to go with me on the trip, yet at the same time they knew it may not work out cause of school. And they don't know that I've mentally deteriorated so much so that the only thing keeping me alive is the only unsupervised trip to the mall I've ever (and at this rate, will ever) gone on. I hate how they're babying me, I hate how they ignore me when I reach out for help but still heavily vent to me, and I hate how I feel like I can't count on anyone to give me information on what's happening.

It hilarious how only a few hours ago I told the psychiatrist that I'm not acutely suicidal. But look at me now! Just that! As if I could tell anyone and risk being ghosted, whisked away by police or the ambulance or being forced another exorcism. At this point, if it turns out they're forcing us to go to school on Friday without any breaks, I'll just kill myself. I already have the tools lmao. I'm not worried abt other ppl, since I already despise humanity (especially ppl I know personally/about) in general. At this point I'm tired of having every potentially happy thing snatched away from me. If happiness from death is a guaranteed, I'll just embrace the opportunity.

"Can you please help me to understand, so that I can try see things from my depressed ex's perspective?",3,"Hi all,

I'm really hoping to hear the perspectives of those of you who suffer with your mental health. Do you find it difficult to exert an effort in a relationship while struggling with depression? Particularly those who aren't in therapy or taking medication. 

The reason I ask is because my now ex boyfriend of just over a year broke up with me almost a month ago because he was struggling with depression. He had been feeling extremely overwhelmed with everything in his life and his coping mechanism was to avoid everything and kind of shut down and isolate himself. He told me he makes no effort to organise meet ups with friends. He hasn't seen most of them since November, and only goes along if they are the ones to plan something. He lost his sex drive, lost enthusiasm in doing the things he once enjoyed and all around just seemed very apathetic toward his life, had low self esteem and would often talk down about himself. 

His reason for initiating our break up was that he felt he wasn't being fair to me. He wasn't enthusiastic about meeting me or making plans with me anymore, it was always me that made the plans. From my perspective, I was okay with making the plans because I had researched a lot about depression so that I could be a supportive partner and understood that it was important to get him out doing things that he used enjoy. I also gave him plenty of space and didn't go over the top with dates or plans, just things that we could still enjoy together and get him out from isolating. I always ensured he knew I was there for him through anything and that I loved him very much. 

I didn't want the break up by any means, I wanted us to stay together and I would've tried my best to be a supportive, loving partner while he sought help. But he just felt that most days he couldn't deal with people in general, not the person themselves, but the obligations, situations, stress that they bring. He said that he didn't want to end things, but felt very hopeless and felt like he'd just make me miserable in the end. 

So I write this to you all, not looking for advice on how to win him back, but just to help understand his perspective for ending our relationship and choosing to struggle alone instead of allowing me to be by his side. In the worst times, it can be very difficult not to take personally or not to feel good enough or that I could've done more for him. I just want to try and accept it now so that I can begin to heal and move on, however long it takes. Thank you. 

**TLDR: Depressed boyfriend broke up with me because he was struggling and feeling overwhelmed by everything, felt he couldn't put in a proper effort for a relationship, felt apathetic, numb, unenthusiastic, and felt he was being unfair to me and let me go, because he thought he would just make me miserable. I'm just looking to understand his perspective, from others here who struggle or have struggled with maintaining a relationship in the past while depressed too.**",13vnej3,Terrible_Ship6141,1685445198.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vnej3/can_you_please_help_me_to_understand_so_that_i/,,Depression
why can't I find love (depressed),9,"why can't I find love

I have so much love to give, but nobody to give it to. 
It seems no matter who I talk to, something wrong plays out. I'm only 19 and know I'm young still. Everybody says that I'll find somebody some day but I just don't believe it. It's so hard to wait when all I can do is want to find love right now. It's made me so depressed and have such a negative view on life now.

I went on a date the other day with this beautiful girl (we've known each other for a bit). She was so excited and eager to see me a few days before (I saw her at a graduation) and mentioned we could go out. We did and she seemed so uncomfortable and awkward. My intuition is extremely accurate and I just know she wasn't having it. I have no clue what I did. I mentioned a follow up date but she made an excuse that she was busy. She didn't mention another time. It just hurts so much when you get attached too easily, thinking you have a chance for a romance. I know it wouldn't have worked out long since she is a senior in high school and I'm a sophomore in college. I just wanted a ""summer girlfriend"" or just a ""friend"" to share memories with.

How did you guys find somebody...after years of eagerness for love? And what do you recommend I do, besides going out and meeting girls, to ease my pain - pray, be Stoic, etc?

Sorry for the rant. Nobody understand how I feel and I was hoping some of you guys might empathize.

"I want to cry for absolutely no reason, I’m scared by it",1,"I’m a 19 year old guy who has been battling stress and anxiety for almost two years now, I’ve had to fight it daily now. I’m young but I’ve been having anxieties about having diseases like ALS or Dementia at my ripe age. I could go on and on about this but this.. isn’t the forum for that. So I was hoping to see if people would relate to me to give me some relief and comfort. 

For around a couple weeks now, I’ve been battling this strong urge to cry or weep uncontrollably at almost the drop of a hat. I noticed that they usually occur later at night too, but I’ve had a few episodes appear during the day as well. Something as simple as being yelled at, watching a sad scene, or even getting a bit excited or loud causes this feeling to intensify to the point where I feel the tears fully settle into my eyes. They’ve been happening at work a lot as well. I always have to stop myself from talking and really focus on myself to get myself to calm down.. but it doesn’t usually go away until a long time. Even when I want to let the tears come out so I could finally get some release out of my system, the tears don’t end up coming out anyway.

It scares me, it scares me greatly. I’ve had some level of depression since I was a kid. Never cracked or cried for a super long time and even when I did, it wasn’t often. But now, after this year occurred and my anxiety has reached its pinnacle, I find myself suddenly feeling these powerful urges at some random time of the day wanting to cry so badly. I don’t know if this is normal, or even concerning for people with depression, but I feel helpless to the situation. Does anyone else really feel this and all of a sudden, even after years of depression?",13vke7d,MatthewTheDeity,1685434893.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vke7d/i_want_to_cry_for_absolutely_no_reason_im_scared/,,Depression

I am both physically and mentally burnt out by the demands of society. The concept of money, politics, social standing and materialism is exhausting. I also feel like I was given the bad luck of the draw with this body of mine. Just feels all misplaced. I also question why am I still in the same town I grew up in for the past few decades. Yet I can't leave because my spouse wants to stay here and raise our children. We also have a child on the way, but has complications. I literally have no friends here because they either died or left town. Then there is my rough marriage which has had problems (spouse cheated on me) and we get into occasional arguments. I am also stuck living with family members. Right when we move out, find ourselves back to square one. There is so much going on that I am literally screaming internally. I need to escape from this nightmare. I can't sleep because of this. What is my purpose here? No seriously? I think I forgotten my assignment. What did I do to derserve all this?

And not only that but I am fully aware that I am in a bad place and am really tired and I know what I need to do to get better, but I am really tired and the thought of doing anything exhausts me. Also, I just simply don't find meaning to it all, I keep thinking ""what's the point?"".

I'm still living with my family, I haven't worked in not months..Years... years man. I have deep gratitude for my parents not kicking me out.

I have/had friends, and a regular life but I ""ghosted/not talked to"" the ones that were close to me for years. Started from simply not liking myself looking ugly and fear of judgment self-esteem anxiety and depression issues and being on social media. It's just so stupid. But I let it spiral into a mess. 

It’s very childish, but I can't get over social media, how my life is, how I didn’t like myself, feel like I'm being judged for being inactive on it, and if I'm on it how many followers, likes I have. Since I've been inactive in life, I don't know if people I know even want to be associate with me, I know some don’t. 

I want to reconnect with, at least try but I know they've all progressed, and I made little progression. And it’s been so long. My personality is dry, I don’t speak up as much and not as outspoken/opinionated as I should be for my age, and never had a long-term relationship. I still literally can't drive and I have no money at the moment. And being inside so much I have an introverted mindset. And I know it will be awkward, I’ll be looked down on, and I don’t have much for what I’ve been to for the past years, that even if I were even to get a response.

I want to change, I really need, I know I can, but I'm still the problem. I know I just need to do, and it’s the only thing I can do, but it’s just fear and knowing at this point. And honestly, it's too much doubt and judgment, and I really failed, and letting the people who were trying to help me down, and people judging me win. 

I have goals, I still want to do computer science, focus on web dev, and music, but I’m doubting myself so much if I capable to do any with how I am. 

I’ve been very close to the edge but for what it is I can’t disrespect my parents by doing it, but at the same time I bring so much shame and couldn’t do simple thing for years. There’s a lot more embarrassing things that happened just day to day, from the years but this post would be a lot longer. I’m very embarrassed I have these issues, honestly.

I have no friends, I’m overweight, I’m addicted to food and overeating, I’m perpetually broke and nothing I used to enjoy brings me any happiness anymore. 

These are some of the many issues I’ve found myself suffering with. I know I’m not alone and that a lot of young men especially, suffer with the same things I deal with. But that fact doesn’t bring me any comfort. 

I used to have a good group of friends. Really good people who were attempting to help me lose weight and really cared about being there for me. I treated them poorly and pushed them away to the point that they want nothing to do with me. Now I have nobody. I’m isolated. Not to mention I’m overweight and ugly so I struggle to make friends now.

All in all, I don’t know how to solve these problems. I’ve found myself crying and pounding my head with my fists almost every night. It sounds childish and maybe it is. I often think about driving into the nearby mountains and shooting myself. I’ve drafted goodbye messages to close family but haven’t fully made a plan to do so. 

In reality, I do not want to die. I want to stop suffering. I want to love myself and feel healthy. I want to wake up in the morning and not feel so awful and sluggish while I get ready for work. I want friends to spend time with. I want hobbies I enjoy and look forward too. I want SOME purpose but I am struggling to find it.

Can antidepressants cause derealization/depersonalization?,2,"Hi guys, so I've been on antidepressants for 6 months now. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago, I started to feel like I'm not me, if that makes sense. 

The conversations I'm in, even the sentences that I'm currently saying feel like they belong to someone else and I am just reading/watching/being told about it. It was to the point that every time I glance at myself in the mirror, my first thought would be that ""Oh, hey, a stranger"". 

I had to remind myself that those things  happened to me, and that is me in the mirror. This feeling only lasts for a fraction of a second every time, but it is happening more and more often now. 

A quick Google search tells me that it might be derealization/depersonalization. So I just want to ask if this is a common side effect or if I am having another mental disorder on top of my depression and anxiety. Thanks so much",13vhswe,SleepySheep6499,1685425493.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vhswe/can_antidepressants_cause/,,Depression
"You can read if you want, I’m severely depressed and I need help but can’t ask for it, I’m venting",4,"

Hey, I don’t really know where to begin. I’m 16 and I was adopted when I was a baby. Don’t remember anything about my birth mother except that she was selfless enough to adopt me out due to her situation (which wouldn’t have been able to sustain me I guess). Anyways, some more on me, I have ADHD, severe anxiety, and depression. On top of this, I’m addicted to marijuana and nicotine. I NEED HELP! I’m asking for advice, what to do, what steps I should take in my life. 

Currently, living with both parents, don’t talk to my dad at all and my mother takes care of me but I can get very angry and snap out if something frustrates me and it causes her to get very cold towards me, which I understand. I just can’t help it and I want to tell her how much I appreciate her but I can’t do it. I know I feel remorse after every argument but I can’t apologize, digging me into a deeper divide in my relationship with my mom. 

For school, I suck, I have a 2.4 cumulative and next year I will be starting my junior year. I  do want to pursue college and i want to make my parents proud but I just cant do my homework and stuff outside of class, I have a shitty attendance too. Additionally, I have a older brother who successfully graduated from an ivy league and I’m just a failure in his shadow. I just don’t have anyone I can talk to and my problems seem to multiply month by month. Soon, I’ll literally have zero things to be happy about, zero things to even be here for. I’m just lost and I need help and advice, or maybe this is a vent?

Completely alone barely have any family and no friends,5,I’m completely alone almost every single day. I’m an only child with only one parent that is in prison that i have nothing to do with. and it gets sooo lonely. Like I’m not close with the few cousins I have and it’s like they could care less about me even when I reach out to them and I don’t have any friends because making friends is difficult when you’re autistic and have trust issues after being talked shit about so much. So it’s making me question why I’m even still living if all I’ll ever experience is hatred and contempt by almost everyone I come in contact with. I want a relationship. I just want friends and family but I can’t even have that because you can’t make people love or care about you… and that’s what hurts it’s like I’m naturally defective and missing out on a base level form of connection that most everyone in the world has and it’s so isolating … even when I’m around people I feel alone and it haunts me I hate this feeling,13vh4fu,misanthropicman85,1685423064.0,18,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vh4fu/completely_alone_barely_have_any_family_and_no/,,Depression
I feel invisible,1,"
I (26F) can’t stop hating myself and wanting to kill myself. I feel like no one likes me and that I’m nothing. There’s this girl in my somewhat friend group that I hang with (they are my roommates) who everyone loves and she’s so fun and exciting. We were playing a drinking game and no one picked me at all to answer a question but everyone picked her and everyone else but mainly her. Throughout my life, I’ve been excluded from peers. I’ve always been rejected. 

I had a similar situation in the past in a past relationship with a similar girl I think she was flirting with my bf and my bf likes her. He says he doesn’t but I feel he does. Idk if it’s just my ocd overthinking or he’s lying. I get triggered whenever I’m around her and feel intimidated because of the idea of my bf liking her. I don’t know who to trust. I’m losing myself. 
Sometimes I notice she stares at me in a mischievous way but maybe just in my head. 

tl;dr: I am invisible and no one wants me around.",13vgzat,upsidedownsq,1685422621.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vgzat/i_feel_invisible/,,Depression
so unmotivated,9,"I’m just so tired. Tired of being tired of not doing anything all day. And then miraculously being tired *despite not having done anything all day. 

Applied to school. Didn’t get in. Honestly water off my back, despite it being a coarse centred around something I really enjoyed, and really wanting it at one point. Despite everyone thinking I’m invested. 

I’m tired of being “out there” in order to find a job because the longer I’m out, the more I hate how I carry myself. Fast forward to feeling so utterly useless to the people around me because I don’t work. Telling people over and over that I’m “looking around” is getting really old. I genuinely do want to progress in this area. 

But it can be so difficult to muster up an ounce of esteem or love for myself. I borderline hate myself sometimes. I don’t think I’m all that intellectually capable, or well spoken, or attractive. My weights been such a pain in the ass my whole life. It makes it hard to actually want to discuss with people what I want out of life, because half the time I don’t even fucking know. I realize in that moment that I haven’t given myself the actual time of day to properly think about it, or believe I deserve it at all. 

I can’t/don’t even tell people I feel this way. I don’t want people to worry, or think I’m trying to make excuses. I’m not diagnosed, and I’m constantly doubting if how I feel is actually as bad as it feels. Or if I’m just lazy. Hell I didn’t even know if I should post this here. But I can’t, for the fucking life of me, put any of this into words in a way it would actually get it all across. To anyone, whether I think they’d try to understand or not. 

It feels as if I’m constantly dragging around another version of myself that *refuses* to move, constantly digging it’s heels in the ground and socking me in the back of the head.

Alittle more backstory 13 years prior to the explosion, he also injuried his back from falling from a loading dock working for FedEx. This back injury made him develop really bad neuropathy in his legs, and hands, arms etc. So with the burns he has now, (they are healing this happened roughly 3 months ago) its flaring up the neuropathy extremely bad hea in alot of pain it's sad to see him like this. The hard part is he is being told by the doctor that he needs to slow down drastically in his physical activity, so that he doesn't wind up in a wheel chair and or bed ridden. I will add the burns are physically healed they are just still internally healing its alot of new skin but it's looking good.

"Realistically when is to late to make big ""changes"" internally with TRD?",1,"For context I've a treatment resistant depression diagnosis with some other diagnoses like PTSD in there for the last few years been in psychiatric care since I was 8 including years long hospital stays along the way, tried every antidepressant, mood stabilizer all that and done psilocybin assisted therapy, ketamine  RTMS all that and had some periods of remission enough to get my masters and work but the last two years have been bad basically the whole time in hospitals. My psychiatrists over the last few years don't really subscribe to the serotonin hypothesis and the general agreement is that i was medicated too much to young on stuff that's not really proven in a modern context. They subscribe more to the neuroplasticity model but with that I'm turning 27 and I just wonder if it's really possible to change who you are with such a inbendedl part of yourself at this age. I know its not really a popular opinion but in disability studies and stuff there an understanding that disability is a spectrum and that the notion of being ""high functioning"" is the same as less severe there no like moral fibre difference or whatever and thats not diminishing people like myself who don't fall in the centre of that spectrum. I've seen that with spending so much times in institutions most of my friends are dead from those places or back in centres and hospitals of the rest of their life. Then theres what I call ""university student"" depressed which is still awful but there is a huge difference when you spend time in these places. The issue is I fluctuate between these two spectrums i did go to the university, I signed a small record deal that covers my basic needs granted i cant make anything more  but at the time I've spent more of my life in hospitals and these places then outside them. Especially the last two years I've felt like i've fallen more in line with the instituonlized side of the spectrum and depending where I fall I'm either doing horribly and will die like my freinds or I'm doing great but might still die. Can you change at 27? Like deeply fundamentally and neurological from something so a part of you? If anyone has any thought's I'd be very grateful. It's also worth mentioning i qualified for MAID in my country for another condition so after two years of a lot of attempts that parts easier knowing I can peacefully when I'm ready not in a distressed state of mind. Thank you for your reading this anyway is means a lot, I just feel myself dying, not eating, not seeing anyone, wetting the bed from nightmares, not able to function and I have never seen that side of the spectrum get better.

I do not want to live this way. I want to be happy. I’m trying, I’ve been trying different medications, therapy and everything. I am just so tired. I don’t want to do it myself because I don’t want to leave my mom, I don’t want her or my brother to walk into a house they’ve made a home and it feel empty. I don’t want to pass this onto them.

anyone know how to move?,0,"disclaimer im not close to being officially diagnosed i just realize i have a large amount of depressive symptoms and figured you guys probably know how to help more than anyone.


I've found myself unmotivated to do basically anything, showering, brushing teeth, all that self care stuff but its even worse because my mom broke her leg recently. i have to help her move around, cook, clean, and we've gotten a puppy just a week ago who isn't even potty trained. 
The point is it's all a lot of stress, its probably nothing to the normal person but im far from that and im not used to this level of responsibility and on top of it this seemingly endless episode of sadness makes it even hard to get out of bed and i have people relying on me.

Is it worth seeking treatment?,3,"So I’ve been fighting depression for most of my life. I was diagnosed at 11 and started therapy. I started medication at 15. Therapy and medication went on and off for 15ish years. I never felt like they had a benefit.

How to stop myself from seeking comfort from food (junk food mostly),10,"Sometimes that’s not food, that’s love. Food is my second best friend, but I love it and hate it at the same time

Yes I do have eating disorder and serious body image issue, but all of this actually started with my depression ( I was definitely bigger 3 years ago but I didn’t have any problems with that back then) 

I think depression triggers my ED so I want to make a post here to see if anyone else are having the same problems as me. 

I constantly want food to distract myself from bad moods and regret immediately every time after having them( so sometimes I throw up🥲) I  have gained 15kg in a really short time which makes me hate my body so much. I’m in my final week rn, everything is just getting worse . i have to put food in my mouth non stopping otherwise i could be feeling so anxious and panic, couldn’t do anything even could not sit still on my chair for 1min, my heart beats so fast feels like I’m almost gonna have a heart attack. I don’t keep any snacks even fruits at home recently because I was trying to stop myself from binge eating so I have to rush to the nearest grocery store to grab a bunch of junk food and shove all of them in my stomach real quick.

I’m not sure if I can handle the changes happening in my life and I’m not sure what to do,1,"I’m a young man still in high-school so I don’t exactly know the hardships of adult life but, I’m almost done my grade 11 year and it feels like adulthood is right around the corner. I mean it is only one more year. I just feel like it’s all moving to fast and my friends who I’m closest with who are actually graduating will leave me behind and I’ll be left alone like I was before. The people that I hold dearly are gonna become adults soon and the people who are my age seemingly have their whole lives charted out. Which I know specifically this next thing will be stupid little teen angst but the girl who I ""like"", is so obviously not interested and is even graduating. Apart of me thinks these people leaving might be a good thing, have hard restart in a way.

Even just 2 years ago I could imagine how I’d be when I’m an adult but now I can’t see myself going passed 20 and more recently I can’t see myself going passed this summer. The people around assume that I live a carefree life because my family is a little more well off compared to the other people in my area, and yea sure I have stuff but I don’t have any of the things in life that I actually mattered to me. Material gain has never been an issue but emotional gain and growth has always felt so out of reach. 

I have countless friends and family members who have these wild expectations for me. Because I took an IQ test once and it was a little above average, people assume that I’m going to be a mega millionaire and not even assume they expect and demand it of me. 

It sounds quite sad but the only thing that keeps me going nowadays is my cat. My family doesn’t listen, my friends don’t need to know and therapy just feels like I’m talking to a brick wall.

Numbness,1,"After 20+ years my grandparents are moving back to Mexico for their retirement. I love both, but especially my grandmother. Right now I went over to help her look through some of the stuff she's leaving and this numbness took over me. After like 10 minutes of being with her I told her that I was leaving back to my house. To that she responded with a semi-long ""rant"" of sorts about how I don't spend time with them anymore like I used to and how I'm no longer in need of my grandparents. Usually I would reassure her that I love them and that I still need them, but I just stood there. After she was done she tried to give me things "" do you like this bag"" ""do you like this shirt"", and again usually I would say yes even if I didn't like it, but I said no. And that clearly hurt her. And I still didn't say anything. She looked like she wanted to cry and I just said ""I'm going go leave now"". I don't feel anything. I think I shutdown the minute it clicked that she was  leaving. And I know when she leaves I'm going to just break down. But again for now I'm sort of just numbness.

How to help with depressed co-worker,1,"Hi. My(27F) co-worker (47M) was diagnosed with depression disorder 5 years ago and seems to be exhibiting symptoms again. 

He was unmotivated with work and life. He always send me messages about how he's so done with life and that there is no joy anymore. I can't even talk to him about normal stuff because it gets so depressing so quickly (Like if I say the weather is good , he will say ""Later it wouldn't be"") 

I told him to go seek help with his doctor and said he couldn't because it was too expensive even though I, myself, was able to find a doctor covered by our company.

I feel like he just doesn't want to seek help and would rather rant to people. Some people don't even want to talk to him because they also feel down after listening to him. I don't want to reach that point before I can help him.

Does it get better?,2,"Before covid i (26m) was in an extremely healthy, loving and fulfilling relationship. I worked out regulalrly, went out with my friends, and just overall, i enjoyed life. Then covid hit, i didn't realise at the time but being indoors so often, I became used to that way of life. While i generally enjoyed getting out and socialising i was always a little bit shy. This was excarbated during lockdown. post covid, I found myself to be socially anxious, i started smoking a lot of weed and generally stayed indoors when i could. I was still in my relationship, and we were still very much in love, however i saw that she was concerned. Then it happened, midway through last year I had my first depressive episode. Sure I had been sad before, i had even been seeing a psychologist to work through my issues, these issues included the social anxiety that I was going through as well as some things that were happening in my family life. But when this episode hit, i was not prepared. I had bouts of depersonalisation, slept all day, didn't have motivation to do anything at all, contemplated suicide, quit my stable job with a clear and defined career path, and worst of all, i felt as if i didnt have any feelings for my partner anymore. Over the next 6 or so months, i slowly got back to feeling somewhat ""normal"". I got back into work, started taking antidepressants, got back into sport and just gave a little bit more effort in trying to fix myself. but at some point i guess i just gave up on being the person I was before all of this. i thought i was going to get better, but this black dog just stuck around and no matter how hard i tried, i never felt like myself. i replay all these scenarios in my head, the way i acted during my episode, i just have so many regrets. my partner tried her hardest to help me, but i just let her down and sunk into the way i was feeling. she loved me so much, but in the end, she could see how much i had changed. she fell out of love. she left me earlier this year. she wanted me to just focus on myself. it really was a case of you don't know what you got till it's gone. i don't blame her but i can't forgive myself for this. i can't make sense as to why i feel this way. i can't see myself getting better. why does my brain make me feel this way? why can't i just snap out of it? for every good week i have, i have 2 bad weeks. i overthink, i replay situations over and over, i wish i could just go back in time with the things that i know now. I wonder what it would be like to just write a letter and let myself go. i feel so lost, like im starting my life over again, like i have no direction, that i will never find anyone else, that i will never be happy, that the old me is gone forever. 4 years ago, everything was great, im just so disapointed that i let this happen to me.",13vbwzm,nystyler,1685408106.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13vbwzm/does_it_get_better/,,Depression
My ex was right. Now I understand the greatest joke of my life.,5,"This afternoon, my now ex had confessed to cheating on me. I wish I could say that I was suprised, but I was not. I expected him to do it. Since every relationship ended with them cheating, this wasn't out of the ordinary for me. No, I wasn't mad or heartbroken in any way. I was and still am upset because I was hoping to be wrong this time...silly me. 

During his confession, he expressed that he didn't think love was real. Now that I think about it, he is right. Love isn't real. It's nothing but a silly chemical reaction in the brain. Love is something worthless, mediocre, and hilariously stupid. My whole life I've been chasing something that I desperately wanted. I wanted love from my mom, but I never got it. I wanted love from peers, but I never got it. I wanted love from romantic partners, but I never got it. 

I am a fool. I am pathetic. I was ignorant to think that someone would love me...that someone could love me. I am not someone who will ever experience such a made up emotion. Parts of me wonder why I'm not angry. Why do I not lift my head to the sky to curse the universe? Why do I not beat myself up? Why am I so nonchalant? I suppose that I am tired. Actually, I'm exhausted. My heart is empty, I suppose. Tis better to be a husk, I suppose. 

It wouldn't be a tragedy without a laughable, ridiculous ending: I am pregnant with his unborn. The one I thought that was made from love was made from a lie.

Hi, first of all, sorry for my imperfect english, it's my 2nd language.

So, i've gone through depression around two years ago after around a year and a half of pure suffering, however my therapist was extremely helpfull and he succesfully helped mi through it.

A bit about me and my situation.

I'm almost 20, just graduated high school (equivalent in my country), and my life would be easily described as miserable, I am a small youtuber (10k subs) that burnt out ages ago and right now i only do it for money, which all goes to my drug addicted brother and my mother, because we are struggling finnancially since i can remember. 

I just can't get out of bed anymore, I can't sit at my desk for more than an hour without severe head pain, i'm trying to learn how to code to try and find a job, i'm also trying to get a job in marketing which im unsucessfull in, after dozen courses and around 50 sent cv's i still didn't get accepted anywhere which at this point makes me question my will to live.

My normal day starts at 10AM, when i finally get up from bed after laying there for 4 hours scrolling through tiktok and frying my dopamine receptors. Then i force myslef to do my youtube job for a few hours, and then i get to learning programming and marketing (courses and similar stuff), i finish my day at 12PM, laying to bed, crying silently so i don't bother my housemates, my girlfriend thinks i'm okay, because i try to hide everything from her to not stress her out, she always gets emotional whenever she hears about my mental health and i can't stand her crying about my problems when she has a life of her own.

It all has been like this for around a month and i'm really exhausted mentally from all that stuff, i wanna get a job and move out, but i'm afraid it'll only make everything worse, and i don't even know when/if i'm even gonna be able to get any real job.

Please, every advice will be helpfull. Thanks for reading.

I am about to turn 35(M), and for my entire life everyone I have ever met, even strangers, have said I have everything going for me. And yet, I have always felt like an absolute loser. In short, I hate my life, and I hate how I have wasted so much of it. And I can not change. I think there is something deeply broken inside me.

**My Background**:

On paper, I have everything. I'm a young doctor. I was top of my class in high school and voted class president, graduated with honors in college, and got accepted into multiple medical schools. After I became a doctor, I actually got a side gig acting and modeling. People have always told me I was good looking (although I don't see it), so I thought I would move to Hollywood. Within the first three days I landed my first TV acting job as a side character's boyfriend, (even though I had never acted before in my life). My patients often say they love me, and the older ladies are always trying to set me up with their daughters. I regularly workout, and have always had a slender athletic build.

**And yet...**

I have wasted my life. I have no family expect for my grandmother, who I live with to take care. I have no friends to call or hang out with. I have always been the quite, loner nerd in the corner. I can not tell you the number of times growing up when teachers asked if I was okay because I was so quite. I would always lie and reply back with my stock answer of, ""oh, I'm just tired"". I never went to a school dance or prom (even though I was asked by girls). I never went to a birthday party in first grade, or a party in college. Never been invite to a gathering or a wedding because I have no friends to invite me. I have never been to a nightclub. I only went to a bar once when I was 27 because I wanted to know what it was like; I sat by myself playing crosswords on my phone until I eventually left after 30mins. (It was nice though to get free drinks from a group of ladies there. But I did not talk to them as I have no self-confidence)

I WANT to socialize, but at the same time I hate it. I've been able to develop a mask I wear when I interact with other people. Whether its patients, or the stranger behind the cash register. When I leave my home, I become a fake person. I have never had a true relationship with anyone, and I'm not sure I can. I often find it funny when people say they are sad and can't form normal relationships while at teh same time talking about just getting out of one; meanwhile I have never been in a single relationship. I often wonder if I am missing the part of my brain that can empathize with others. I once had a guy in college describe me as the following: ""You're like an alien, who has been observing human behavior for years. And you came down to Earth and you're interacting with others, and you're able to mimic human behavior really really well. Like 99% there. But there is just something off.""

**My relationships:**

My father was very strict. The type of guy who expected the best and nothing else. Almost daily, since I could remember at the age of 5 he would call me a ""f#cking loser"" and would tell me how its a ""dog-eat-dog"" world and that everyone was selfish and would leave me for dead if given the chance. I understand why my father was harsh, considering he was abandoned and orphaned by his parents at a young age. But being told you are a loser, and that the world is a cruel place, and that you should kill yourself if you are unable to achieve anything but perfection... well, that creates lasting scars. As I said earlier, I only have my grandmother at the moment, and she's is barely there. And I have never had any true friends. I see others socialize and talk, and they make it look as easy as breathing. But I just don't get it. Its like I never developed that part of my brain, the ability to socialize, when I was growing up. The only way I can interact with other people is by putting on my fake mask and repeating phrases I see in movies/tv show when characters socialize and interact.

I guess I should also mentioned I have never been in a romantic relationship. Never even held a girl's hand. Growing up, any sorta of friendship/relationship was discouraged by my father. All that mattered to him was good grades so I could get in a good school and get a good job. To him, socializing and fun could come later in life after I was established. So here I am now, 35, and never been on a date. I recently tried downloading Hinge/Bumble and deleting and re-downloading it a million times out of nerves. (Growing up in a household where anything less than success resulted in nightly beatings, needless to say I have a hard time putting myself in situations where there is a risk of failure.) I did not have much success on the apps, and eventually deleted them out of frustration. I would get maybe 5-10 matches a day (which I later found out was a good amount for a guy, i guess?) but they never went anywhere, because again, I don't know how to talk to people. Also, I would assume if I told someone that at the age of 35 I never been on a date before, they would rightfully think there was something wrong with me.

I know there are social online groups you can go to meet other people, and make friends, but at this point in my life, I have no interest. Even if I did force myself to go, I know I would just sit on the sidelines. I could put on my fake mask and throw out the charm and socialize and ""befriend"" others, but inside I would feel hollow. Its not that I can't socialize. I can. I know how to. This fake persona of mine is a skill I have perfected over the years. In fact, I am actually really good at it. It's just that I have zero desire. I desire to want to have the desire to socialize, but I don't. I'm dead inside. In social situations, all I think about is how soon I can leave to go home to my dark room and hide under the covers.

**My Daily Routine:**

I wake up, go straight to work, and come straight home. I have no energy or motivation to go outside. On weekends, I sit in my bed, with the blinds shut in complete darkness, watching YouTube or sleeping. I have done this ever since I was in middle school, for 25+ years straight. I tried recently to get out of a years-long depressive funk by going out in public. I went to an amusement park, and ended up sitting for hours on a bench by myself. I just stared at all the happy faces walking by. I never felt so alone in a crowded place before. Being near so many people gave me a panic attack and I had to leave.

**Getting Help**:

I tried twice to reach out for help with a professional. They said they could get me in for an appointment 3 months later. I never bothered to show up. I just don't care. At this point, I've accepted who I am. I go to work to pay the bills, and then the rest of my life I sleep it away, doing nothing. I don;t drink, I've never done drugs. I just sleep my life away. As I get older, the regrets of wasting so much of my life and my youth starts to build up. Even on sites like here, it is hard for me to find others who are depressed that I can connect with. So many people say they are sad and are wasting their life, and yet they were able to go to high school prom (I didn't), or have a first kiss (I didn't), or have a boyfriend/girlfriend (I didn't), or any friends while growing up (I didn't). All these things I missed out on, it makes it hard for me to connect to others. So many life experiences that it feels 99% of the population, even if they are depressed, has still experienced. And when someone finds out I'm a doctor/model, they don't comprehend how I could be so upset and alone and antisocial. I feel like no one truly can understand me.

My father was right. I am a ""f#cking loser"". I've been able to fool the world into believing that I'm this successful, charming young man, but I can't fool the one person who counts. Me.",13va2xi,throwaway_xx529,1685403150.0,2,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13va2xi/people_say_i_have_everything_going_for_me_yet_i/,,Depression

I'll never be happy the way other people are,40,"I just realized something that really fucking hit me like a brick. I am never going to be a happy person. All my life I have struggled with depression and all my life I have said when I get to x point in life, I'll be happy. I get there and I'm not content. I don't mean to say I never have happy moments in life, but that's all they are. They're moments. I've never once in my existence felt just content and at peace with my life and the realization that I will likely never experience that due to my mental illness sort of rocks me. The fact that happiness is only ever going to be fleeting in my life truly makes me hurt. I realize even NT people aren't happy ALL the time, but they at least seem content and not constantly in this veiled state of mind. I feel like there's this partition between me and the rest of the world and that's the state in which I live. I'll have brief moments of happiness and then it's back to just basically breathing.

for background i’m 20, bipolar, dissociative identity disorder, off my meds for the last 3 days. i have been in and out of hospitals and rehabs for years but have recently been doing really good.

i want to sh but i need to be more depressed and in the mood to be able to do it. i stopped taking my meds for one, but i also went back on every habit i have created or gotten rid of. self care, lying, sex, music taste, etc. literally any type of choice i could make i am making it with the goal of getting worse in mind. 

The current self knows this is not what we(my collection of selves) want. i wish to become high functioning again but i can’t when this other self keeps interrupting my plan with her desire to dive into the dark, self destruct, and sh.

i don’t expect anyone on here to fully understand the identities parts but if anyone could provide help or perspective on the simple concept of wanting to be depressed that would be great.

Just Reaching Out There,1,"I'm 15, and I can say I've had depression for around the past year.  Although at first, I can say I didn't know what it was.  I've been on medication for the past couple months, although I haven't really felt a change with it.  I'm also seeing a therapist.  I was reading some posts, and I see people writing how it lasts a while, and some on how you just need a different mindset.  So I guess I am just reaching out to figure out what's normal, and what's the best I can do to make the best of the situation.  

So, quick rundown about me.  I have a group of online friends, we've known each other for around two years now.  Those were what I refer to as the ""good ol' days.""  Funny enough when they begun to focus on school, around half a year later I got my diagnosis.  But they're slowly coming back now, so can this bring my old self back?  In school, I have good grades, and one best friend.  Everyone else I just kinda talk to.  But she's always been there for me.  Sometimes I listen to sad music on purpose to make me cry.  Sometimes I just listen to sad music.  I think I'm becoming comfortable in the sadness, but I know that isn't right.  I've survived a lot too for my age. Bulimia, anorexia, nail picking, attempted suicide, strict parents, and a somewhat uncomfortable ex.  I feel the constant need to have a significant other.  That occupies a lot of my thoughts.  Not necessarily out of self-validation I feel.  Not out of lust, either.  I think maybe I just want to have someone to be mine.  Someone that has me.  Is that normal?  Plus, how do I get rid of those thoughts because they take up a lot of time.  I also feel like all conversations are empty.  Almost meaningless.  Like take someone who might want to spend time with me.  They'll reach out to me to hang out, I agree, but then I fake my emotions.  And my facial expressions.  I upkeep small talk, sometimes even pretending to hold deep conversation.  But other than that I feel empty afterwards.  I think it's because I convince myself they don't care for me, that they're pretending too.  Is that normal?   I pick my skin though.  A lot.  It kind of bothers me, but I found acrylic nails help. 

I guess I just want someone to share their experiences too.  I read through other posts here, so I have a good idea.  What is left to do now?  Do I look towards the future, or do I just try and live in the moment?  Which is best?  Thank you if you got this far.",13va5em,_Crimson_Nightmare_,1685403330.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13va5em/just_reaching_out_there/,,Depression

My wedding is a few days away and all I can think of is how I’ve ruined my life.,58,"I love my husband. Just want to get that out of the way. He is my best friend and I’m happy to be married to him. But looking at the guest list truly has me in tears. I have a couple of coworkwers coming and then family. No one else. He has a ton of family and friends coming.

Since I was idk maybe 14, I have done a great job at cutting people out of my life the second they get too close or know too much. I have never liked the thought of someone being able to hold something over my head, and now I am utterly alone. I have a good job, pets, a husband, and a house which is more than a lot of people, but my god is the loneliness exhausting. I don’t even think my family likes me. How could they like someone they don’t really know? I’m not a good person. I’m quick to judge, anxious, easily angered, and greedy. All of the people that were my friends at some point, I honestly know are better off without me in their lives. I feel like a bad person, so the one good thing I can do would be to remove myself from people’s lives. On the days I keep myself busy with books, projects, or shows, I’m content. On the days I have nothing but time, I really feel like I should’ve killed myself before coming into my husband’s life. I can’t think of a more selfish thing that I’ve done.

Mucuna Dopa and 5-HTP,0,"Hi

Long story short.. I have had mental issues for over 20 years and has been on all kinds of meds, but always with bad side effects, so I have never stayed on them.

The last couple of months I have been researching Nootropics online, and beside vitamins, I started taking 1000 mg L-Tyrosin and 1000 mg L-Tryptophan. I helped me a little, but not enough so after about 2 month I stopped and began taking 200 mg 5-htp and 500 mg Mucuna Dopa.

It really helps, I kinda feel all of my symptoms are gone and the side effects are small. But I read online that you need to cycle of both and that long term use is not a good idea. But then again, meds also has long term consequences.

I don’t know what to do, my doctor/shrink will not discuss this with me and both Mucuna and 5-HTP is not sold in my country.

Is there anyone on here that has personal experience with Mucuna and 5-HTP? If so, your words are kindly appreciated",13v7l9a,TankenDerKunneKomme,1685396828.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13v7l9a/mucuna_dopa_and_5htp/,,Depression

Feel absolutely miserable due to traumatic relationship and family experiences,0,"Was with my Ex for about 2 years then she randomly wanted to move out but not necessarily break up. I couldn’t understand why. Im an incredibly fit 26 year old who has been told im fairly funny and attractive. We lived together for a year and a half then she randomly wanted to leave. I couldnt understand it. We still texted about everyday and around valentines day , we have makeup sex unprotected even though I think i pulled out in time.  I dont think anything about it until 2 months after and she says shes actually pregnant due to a drunk hookup. Im confused as to why she would want to keep it if it is in fact a drunk hookup but she’s incredibly religious and her family is too.  I do realize it could be mine since we had unprotected sex but i pulled out and i dont think it was within the fertile period whereas the other guys dates fit. 



Fast forward to last week and she tells me she actually was dating the guy and they had unprotected sex a few times. During this whole time , i was telling her i wanted to eventually marry her and have a family.  It was a blade through my heart basically … again. Repetively lying and just heart break again after again. I also discovered last year my father wasnt my biological father and she was there consoling me… i just feel so depressed and empty.

So sick of constantly feeling miserable,25,"So, yeah.  My life up to this point has basically been one huge disappointment after another.  I turn 40 soon, and I have to be honest - I don't think there has ever been a single moment in my life where I felt truly happy with my life.  I'm stuck in a job I hate working extremely long hours (60 hour weeks lately), have very few friends, no romantic prospects (OLD has been a huge bust, as has trying to meet people IRL), and quite frankly, no hope that things will improve.

Seriously, my daily schedule pretty much looks like this: Wake up, work 10 or 11 hours, go home, sit in my dark bedroom for hours because I have absolutely no motivation to do anything else, go to bed late (struggle to fall asleep), and do the same the next day.  Chances are, if I make plans to do something, I'll simply decide to stay home when that activity comes around.  And then I'll wonder why I even bothered to try in the first place.

I'll be completely honest and mention that, due to past traumas, I have insanely troublesome trust issues.  Probably explains why I'm such a huge loner, but eh, what do I know about psychology?  And I feel so completely powerless to do a damned thing about all of this.  I can't even find the energy to tackle something as simple as taking a shower, so leaving the house to try to connect with others seems as impossible as curing cancer or building a rocket at this point..

"I feel totally broken, incomplete, and abandoned.",1,"My partner (25) and I (29) have/had been together for about 6 months now. We talked for about two months prior and then started dating early this year. When we first met, there was an instant connection. It just felt good and right. Honestly, we were mad for each other. Being long distant (approximately two hours separated us), we didn't see each other everyday, but we saw each other every weekend, sometimes stretching into the week. It was pure bliss.

And we were good like that for so long. Our time together felt so perfect. We argued so little, we talked about our possible future together a lot, and we had the best inside jokes and running gags. He truly felt like my person and I thought I was his. The first few months, it felt like he would do anything to see me, even if just for a moment, and I felt so loved, so seen. He's moving away in August, something I knew was coming from the beginning, but we had even talked about me going with him. That was still TBD, but it had been discussed a time or two.

But then his dad suddenly passed away at the end of March. It sent him into a tailspin, but in odd ways. He always tried to be the strong one for his family, even though he was the youngest of the four kids. He has always been an overachiever, but it was now showing up in different ways that felt like he was overcompensating with more work, more awards, more whatever to fill the void that his dad left. To be clear, he wasn't close at all to his dad prior to his death, but nonetheless, the death of a parent can shake anyone to their core, especially when you live in the same house.

As a partner who loved my boyfriend, I did what I thought I was supposed to do: I was present. I was there for the service, I was there to help him, his mom, and his siblings around the house, I was showing up at his job with flowers to brighten his day, I was giving him space to spend as much time with friends and family as he needed, I wasn't bringing up his father's death unless he wanted to talk about it, I was trying to be as supportive and caring as possible. He wasn't getting the help he needed, though, choosing to lean on his mom rather than seeking out professional mental help that could help him grieve. Meanwhile, I was burning out. I was still living my life while being on the road nearly every day, trying to be there for him when he couldn't be there for himself.

Things were tense at times, sure, but I still felt like we were on a good path. Then he broke up with me. Yesterday. He said he stilled loved me but just wanted to be friends for now. He said that he couldn't give his best self to me right now and that he wanted to spend more time with his family, that anytime he was spending in a relationship was time he wasn't spending with his family. He wanted to spend the last few weeks he has home with his family, as a single person. He said he felt like his love for me had changed, that he still loved me but he just didn't know how right now.

And I feel totally broken, incomplete, and abandoned. I feel like I lost my better half, my best friend, my partner in life. I know I can't go back and change the loss of his dad. Hell, that kind of loss completely changes a person, but we were in love. I loved him with every fiber of my being and moved heaven and earth to ensure that he was okay, especially the past two months. After the death of his father, I felt like he didn't want to see me as much anymore, like he resented me for occupying his time while his father was still alive.

**But now I don't know what to do. All of my dreams and plans have been dashed. I've lost my best friend, the person I trusted most in the world. I look at the pictures of us together and we were happy, but now there is no 'we,' there is no 'us.' What do I do?

I don't know how to deal with this anymore,0,"I am 22(F). I have been going through a lot for six years now and I have no idea how long is it going to stay like this. So, in 2011, My father bought this home which was in 14 lakhs and we had paid him 8 lakhs it was of 2BHK. he (my father) has bought from someone known to him. He'd told him (the guy who sold us the house). let's call him (A). My father tried to contact him in between to give the rest amount but he didn't answer the phone. So, the amount we had, we spent us in something else. Basically, neither A nor my father took this seriously. He literally didn't contact us for years.  After five years my father's business went down. We were doing good back then. My father used to earn 1 lakh per month that too in 2010. It was considered a good amount in india. Well, the A guy had eventually called us (in 2017) and told us to give the rest of the amount, by the time he called us our business had seen a massive loss. We asked him some time to think this out.

I don’t know what to do,1,"It’s my first time posting on here and I don’t even know if this is the right place, I just don’t know what to do. My room has become my place of nightmares and I live in my own mess because I can never muster the motivation to clean so I just lay in bad and cry and sh as the filth around me worsens. My grades and dropping, I used to be top of all my classes ‘the gifted kid’ the ‘golden child’ but I cant keep up any more and I’m so tired and burned out and I just want to cease to exist but I’m scared I’ll survive if I attempt and have to deal with the consequences. 
The worst part is I don’t have a reason to feel this way, it just keeps getting worse, I have no serious trauma or abusive parent I’m just messed up and burned out and can barely drag myself out of bed to go to school in the morning. I feel constant guilt and doubt that anyone loves me and feel so bad for my girlfriend who has to put up with me. I feel like everyone expects so much from me but I can’t even provide the bare minimum.

Episode after a long while,1,"I haven’t had a depressive episode in a while, say.. a few months? My meds have been helping since I upped the dose recently. But a few days ago, all hell broke loose.

Background:
I was already starting to feel bad. Not showering. Not eating. I don’t usually eat anyway. No appetite whatsoever. When I’m hungry I just snack. So anyway. I had a talk with my manager. She was basically just nasty - bringing up my mistakes and how I’m apparently immature at handling tough situations based on a complaint they received. Content basically saying I was rude. But they didn’t bother listening to my side of the story so….

And the way I was talked down really made me upset. I was told I may not be able to get what I want - a promotion and to further my studies (they sponsor this). It’s sad because I did graduate from a top university. My work is cool, I do my job well (further supported by my colleagues). So I.. I don’t see why.. yeah 

Now:
I haven’t showered in 4 days. I’ve been sticking to a routine of showering at least once a day and I’ve broken the cycle. This was when I knew it was getting bad BAD.

Met my boyfriend today. Went to a cosy place. We were supposed to cuddle, all that. But I ended up sobbing and falling apart like on 4 separate occasions in between..

Just here to rant. Im just lucky I have a loving boyfriend. Don’t know what I would’ve done to myself if he wasn’t in my life. Thank God and the universe for his existence.

TLDR: depressive episode after a long while. Manager made me feel worse. BF held me through my breakdowns.",13v337s,JellyGlittering,1685386153.0,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13v337s/episode_after_a_long_while/,,Depression

Can I give myself a break now?,0,"I've been depressed for decades but only started praying for my life to end from 2014.

I went for cure but it's making me feel worse. Someone told in the past I had to fight for myself, and not let people beat me and despise me.

I am leaving again but I would like it to be clear that the studies went from superb to crap, everything is different there and I'm leaving to save myself, not because I'm running away.

I'm lost,2,"Tl; Dr- burned out, no natural supports, and stuck

I'm dysthymic, had loads (over a decade) of therapy, and medications tweaked to maximize their benefits. I haven't had sex in my marriage for over 6 years (I'm 43) and my s/o won't discuss it or go to counseling. But we have a 7 year old so I try to keep a stiff upper lip. I'm the primary earner and got pressured to get a second masters so I can make more money. I've communicated I'm burned out. My employer doesn't care, family doesn't care, really no one gives a shit.

That is all for context, not here to get sympathy this is just my reality. Where I'm lost is I hit a wall. I don't want to deal with this any longer. If I get divorced I believe the amount I'll have to pay in spousal support will require me to find a creative housing solution since my s/o has not gone back to work despite my urging her to do so. If I leave my job, I can earn more in the long run but will take a hit in the short run. It is a tenured government position so it is consistent if nothing else.

So, I don't know what to expect from putting this out there. I have to purge this shit because my reserves are empty and I'm crashing. I've analyzed the hell out of this and have zero ""good"" solutions, I suppose I need to figure out what the least worst options are and how to accept whatever shit sandwhich I receive.",13v2d08,Unlucky_Box5837,1685384404.0,5,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13v2d08/im_lost/,,Depression
Can anyone relate?,0,"I'm doing my best to improve myself and succeed. But I think that recently I made a series of bad decisions that have in turn really destroyed my mental health. I work warehouse positions for the past 4 years or so, coming from retail, and well I've been trying to get paid more. I was in a pretty comfortable position December 2022 but decided to get out my comfort zone I guess. Almost June now, and I've had a couple warehouse jobs in between that took a different spin. I now am waking up to go to work at 2am to throw trailers of 100lb packages from the floor and in many cases at shoulder level. I got a kudos from my boss and others for being able to work as fast as I did all on my own but I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied because I feel like I'm being congratulated for working unecessarily hard. Idk why they put 3 people in 1 trailer off reasonable boxes containing things like medicine or food but then stick only me inside a trailer full of that for days in a row. Anyway I'm off topic. It's just killing me mostly cuz I feel like a job hopper. I had one other job this year. Prior to that I had a job for almost 2 years and I have another job still ongoing for 3 years. 

I feel like a failure cuz everyone else seems so content doing this type of brutal work at 2am. But I'm just not. My mind is pulling me in 2 different directions. It's saying that just because it's for them doesn't mean it's for me. But then it also says that I'm just failing if I quit. 

I like to stay in warehouse environments at the moment because it works well with a college schedule. I have other options at the moment and I wanna quit so badly but now I'm here thinking about what excuse I can give for leaving so soon after starting. I just don't think it's for me. Specifically, the getting up to be at work at 2am. And this is only one of my worries, just, its the one at the front of my mind right now. Idk if anyone here can relate to being in a constant state of worry. Struggling to think about what I can do to avoid something that may have happened yesterday. Worrying about if I'll have the answers for today. And worrying about what will approach tomorrow.

I don’t see a purpose in life anymore,2,"Hi, I am genuinely surprised by myself for trying to reach out to people and for trying to feel a little bit better. I am a female, 22 and I have been depressed for over 2 years (at least clinically diagnosed, I guess I’ve been that way for the longest). 1 1/2 years ago I put myself into a psychiatry for over a month which helped me a lot but mostly because I had a routine, meds and people to talk to. 
Now I am feeling all depressed and shitty again and really asking myself why I am doing all of that anymore. To let you understand what I am thinking: 

I’ve been struggling to understand why I am putting myself through life. I don’t want to feel the pain of loosing people I love, I don’t want to experience the world going down everyday, I don’t want to be a burden to my friends and family anymore who feel so helpless because they know I am very depressed. I just don’t want to experience all the bad things in life that will crash me. I’ve had enough of all the pain and guilt I have put myself into the last 22 years and I just don’t know what purpose life has.. does anyone understand this? Why do you keep going even though you know that life is going to test you to the limits and you’ll die at the end anyways.

I am not suicidal.,0,"I'm empty and numb. I don't care. I'm sick and tired of being complaisant with what I expect of myself. I ""got out"" of my depression I believed, but I didn't, it just molded around my new beliefs. Either way, it feels bad. It's always felt bad. 

When I discovered I am not a victim,  I thought it cured my depression, but really I just masked it with more intricate beliefs that were better at explaining away reality. Now, they can't satisfy me and my entire existence is crumbling. I am continuing the pain from high school. It reached a point where I had to get better or I would have committed suicide. I couldn't handle the pain, so I armored myself with positivity so as to not fall off the edge. 

I now have the beliefs that allow me to continue the pain where I left off and it will get even worse over time. I cannot fathom the pain I will feel in the future. My beliefs do not allow me to end my life anymore. It feels like I am being relentlessly tortured on my death bed, prolonging death as long as possible.

The meaning in life is completely blocked off from my perspective, and I don't understand because I truly know how beautiful life can be and how much love I have for absolutely everything and everyone. I literally can't handle this pain. 

I feel numb to life, so I want death. I also feel numb to death because of my past experiences and my beliefs on death now. So I want life instead. It feels like I am in a nightmare except the dreamer doesn't exist so the dream can't end. I feel split in half. I feel lost and confused. I need help but I don't want help.

I also have a younger sister who is 16 and I'm 21.

My sister is gonna go to college soon and I'm helping her plan her money so that she can move out for college because that's what she wants. 

my mom has had depression since she was young and all throughout my life and has made attempts at ending her life multiple times, including while I was alive. She also talks a lot about how she wants to die and leave this world and she doesn't want to live.

I always thought I would stay with my mom forever because I felt like if she were alone she would end herself.

now that I'm gone and with my sister getting older that situation I feared so much growing up might become reality.

I feel guilty and I feel sad and I feel bad and I feel so so so so alone.

Should I go to a therapist just to know what to say to my depressed friednd,2,"""If you're depressed, just go to a therapist"".

Unfortunately, it's not that easy to tell them that directly. 

A few weeks ago, my friend (to which had a history in suicide) phoned me about the problem he had with his single-parent mother and his home life. I listened to all his problems and complains politely, and provide a solution the best I can. I thought that he might have a depression and want to direct him to a therapy, but the problem is I don't know how because he is uncomfortable to tell his story to people he doesn't know. 

I am not saying that I also have depression, but should I go to a therapist just to know how to say the right thing, because I'm not really good at talking or persuading people in any case.

In the other note, one my other friend suddenly asked me (as I like science more than he does) whether a paracetamol could cause a depression (in which I said that it shouldn't). I take that this is a hint, but I haven't talked to him about it further.

I think I have depression and anxiety.,2,"Hello I’m a 27 year old female. I’ve been at the same job for 7 years in recent years I’ve been getting really anxious about going in. I had an situation with a customer at work and they said that they were going to complain against me I’ve just phoned in sick cause my mental state is through the roof. I feel bad for work but I can’t go in knowing I’m going to worrying about that all day. 

I live with my parents and my two siblings are still at home, I don’t have much of a social life and the 3 friends I made a college I don’t really speak to on a daily basis. I tend to sit in my room and I’m on phone or laptop, I have moments where I zone out and just go into my own world. I like it there because I don’t have to worry about irl. I feel like I’ve been left behind on a lot of things since I stay at home a lot. I want to go out but I’m not a social person and I get anxiety when I’m by myself.

Why am I like this?,0,"I have a long history of mental health struggles and a lot of trauma in my past.  But the last couple of years have been good.  I haven't needed meds or therapy. I've been happy. I really thought I had beaten all of this.

Two months ago a close friend of mine passed away unexpectedly.  Of course I was grief stricken and sad but that's normal.

But the sadness never got better.

Now I'm tired all the time, I don't ever want to get out of bed or do anything.  It's a struggle just to make it to work.

I had to take a couple of sick days recently because I literally couldn't stop crying for no reason.

It's killed my sex drive and appetite.

I constantly have intrusive thoughts just beating me down with the most negative things imaginable. But even with this constant stream running in the back of my mind, I recognize the thoughts aren't reflective of reality.  But I can't stop them.

I have no reason to feel like this.  Everything in my life is great.  I have everything I could possibly want or need.  I have a great support system and multiple friends who worry about me and check in on me.  There's no aspect of my life that I would change.

Yet I'm so depressed I can barely function.

I feel so awful all the time now and I just wish I could go back to normal. There's no reason for me to be depressed, and yet here I am.",13uyfjn,Equal_Competition_96,1685375166.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uyfjn/why_am_i_like_this/,,Depression
I (20 M) feel like i have accomplished nothing,0,"I used to be a good student. The past 2 years I've barely passed. I'm scared because i won't get accepted in good universities.

Since my dad died in 2020, I've been working. It's a dead end job. Redundant and basically 0 progress. I learned and got good at somethings just so that i have some progress in life. I still get paid the same but have to work more. I can't leave the job because nobody else is looking to hire an A Levels student. Even if they did they wouldn't pay good and it's too much of a risk for me.

My relationship is going through a rocky period. Fights and arguments. They really mess me up and i have 0 urge to do anything besides lay down and think.

Financially I'm a mess. Broken car, unpaid bills, holding off expenses just to get through the damn month.

I want to retire me mom. Forget about supporting my family, I'm barely making enough money to support myself.

Idk where to go in life. Idk what to do in the future. I don't have anyone to take advice from. I don't have so I'm someone that could guide me, help me. I need help. I tried being the tough guy and go through everything myself but i have failed miserably. I have accomplished nothing.

Idek why I'm writing this. I guess I'm just venting. I honestly don't know what to do. I've contemplated ending it (iykwim) before too. I'm getting the same thoughts now. I don't want to go that route.

"I'm married and depressed, in that order.",5,"Some context: I (male) married back in 2020 to a girl I met in college. We'd been dating for 4ish years and had known her for 2 years more. A little after a year into our marriage, I was medically diagnosed with depression.

Now, some of my depression *symptoms* started maybe a year or two *before* getting married - gradually increasing apathy & fatigue, and decreasing energy & motivation. I really started noticing it more within the 12 months prior to marriage. It mostly exhibited itself in low energy and lack of motivation despite having a job I loved. Maybe it was because I moved away from a great college life to a city where I didn't know a soul.

So all that's going on... then in 2020, I left said job I loved to move to a town to get married to the girl. Of course, 2020 is going on all the while. Couldn't find a job for a couple months. Eventually got an offer at a job I only kind of wanted, started the week after our wedding (August 2020), and proceeded to be discontent with that job for the next year and a half. Late 2021 came the official diagnosis. Since then, my feelings about my job have improved and I've been promoted and given lots of opportunity, so overall I feel better about my job.

So all that was the context, which gets me to my main point - While depression may have started before our marriage, I think our marriage is sustaining depression. That started shortly after our wedding, when my wife and I started to discover that we can't have s\*x. We'd later find out she had a microperforated himen (extra thick and painful tissue with no real opening). About a year later, she had that surgically removed, but the issue didn't resolve as she was also dealing with v@ginismus (extreme sensitivity). I was patient, gracious, and loving for a long time, but I've grown impatient and increasingly resentful over nearly 3 years. We've successfully pene+rated only 3 or 4 times, and only one of those was enjoyable for both of us. She also has a much lower s\*x drive than me, so my s\*xual needs aren't being met, not even close.

Now, I'll be intentionally vague here, but we are also both religious. Because of that, she's not really willing to ""explore"" alternatives. Also because of our religion, divorce isn't really an option I'll realistically consider, and I knew that going into marriage. Regardless, over the last year or so, divorce has been on my mind constantly. I find myself wishing I'd never married. I miss the life I was starting to build for myself in my last city, because even though I was maybe still dealing with depression, I was enjoying myself there. I had freedom to spend my money and have fun and do what I want, but my wife is very conservative with money and hates when I spend, so I don't feel like I can do anything I want. Somehow I also ignored how different our interests and personalities actually were while we were dating.

So here's what that has to do with depression - I think I was able to manage my depression, even without meds, before we wed. But, I think all these issues we've dealt with have caused my depression to persist, even with meds. I've always been a pretty gracious, understanding, and forgiving person, I think, but I've become so bitter and resentful and full of hate (I'm not sure I've ever actually hated anyone til now)... but I can't divorce. So I just feel super stuck.

Worse, my wife has no idea I feel this way, I don't think. I've told her that some of my depression may be sustained by some of the issues we've dealt with, but she has no idea how resentful I've become of her. And I don't want to say anything, because assuming we stay together, I don't want that fear to hang over her and over our relationship for the rest of our lives. So she thinks everything is fine, while I have no idea how I'm going to deal with this the rest of my life.

I have no f\*cking idea how to keep living with this (metaphorically only; thankfully, self-harm hasn't been one of my symptoms).

EDIT: I'm posting this looking for people's thoughts, opinions, advice, etc. Of course, I'll have to be the one to decide to do something.

Thoughts as of late,0,"I’ve been feeling anxious as of late. Perhaps it may be because I feel as thought I cannot do anything or that I am incapable of doing things. That i can’t live up to the standards I subject myself to. I am in a place where it feels as though i have no purpose yet theres also a drowning list of things to do. Thinking about attempting this list consumes me and also discourages me from actually trying. I’m lost. I’m 22 turning 23 and it feels as though I’m a failure with no actual achievements that are valid. I’m always in a constant state of feeling suffocated by family matters yet also useless at dealing with my own. I question whether family is just a crutch for my poor effort in making a life of my own. I dont know what I want or where I want to be. Thus I chase after the security of money, what I can buy with my own will. Looking at my peers it seems as though i’m on a timeline, haven’t started my Masters and dont have enough money for a home deposit. Not pretty enough or skinny enough. Sounds like first world problems but I can’t help but wonder why am I even here. 

I have even found a person whom I love dearly yet always question whether they actually love me back. Or if i’m deserving of their love and care. I don’t think i’m enough and I can’t pinpoint where this stems from. Why can’t I be enough for myself to be proud of. I know I am insecure. This constant battle of feeling like a failure and self sabotaging is something i’m trying to overcome. Self sabotaging in the sense where I put less effort in intentionally or sub consciously because i’m already aware of a disappointing outcome. 

I’ve broken my ankle recently and being home has furthermore given me time to settle into how I feel. I have no way of physically escaping what pulls me into feeling this way. Its been pointed out to me that I am anxiously attached. This I really despise about myself, that I can’t be content with being alone and not overthinking or overcompensating things in  my relationship. Its a grappling mindset that I must do extra things to keep my partner interested in me when I know logically he loves me for what I am. Its just a deep pit in my stomach that keeps telling me I’m not good enough for them. Im an over thinker where alone time makes me think i’m unwanted and this really crushes my heart. I jump from conclusion to conclusion and memories from past experiences cloud my perspective.

I’m losing my will to always be there for my family, i’m a failure in my own story, i lack substance in the sense that I’m not happy alone. I’m always seeking validation from my partner. I also feel like i’m chasing the number 23. Theres this strong idea that I should have my life sorted or at least plan heading towards my mid 20s.

All my feelings could boil down to just an existential crisis or a negative outlook on life. But its truly hard to escape doubts and thoughts of my purpose here on earth. Whether I deserve it or actually should even be here. 

I hope I can be better.",13uwf6h,EducatorGullible6503,1685370472.0,1,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uwf6h/thoughts_as_of_late/,,Depression

3 nights ago I attempted Suicide.,2,"I got into a fight with my sister again. Because she cracked jokes to her friends online because I take medication and she insulted my intelligence,  saying ""My mom has to tell me to take my pills. All because I called her a loser for being lazy and leaving our dog outside to play video games. My sister has abused and bullied me my whole life. She's the biggest source of my depression and anxiety. She destroyed my self worth and confidence.  So I unloaded on her and called her every name in the book. Of course she fake cried about it and  told mom that I'm ruining her life, when she ruined mine.


And my mom took her side and called me a selfish son of a bitch.  Of course not understanding my side of things.


And saying I instigated it, when My sister had no business talking about me like that.


So late at night I took my Trazodone and Citalopram and swallowed almost all of them. All my Citalopram and most of my trazodone. And all that happened was I threw up....



I don't understand.  This time I wasn't afraid to die. This time I felt nothing but peace and for some reason I'm still forced to stay here in this place with these people. 


I despise my sister. She is my enemy and  she's a cruel,  selfish,  horrible,  evil human being, just because things didn't work out in her life she has to tear everyone down. 


Mom said my suicide attempt didn't work because I'm not supposed to die. I think that's bullshit. It's probably cause I layed the wrong way. After all my other attempts failing due to fear. This should've been it.  This should've worked.

Can’t seem to look forward to anything in life,0,"
Currently going through a divorce, been separated for two weeks now but its hard and I’m so afraid of marriage now I never want to be hurt like that again or let someone down in marriage to where they feel the need to find someone else. I think I’ve spent my entire life growing up always wanting someone by my side because I was never happy alone and I still dont know how anyone is happy alone in life. But now I just feel as though I can’t be a good husband to someone anymore and dont deserve to waste someone’s time. The one thing I always looked forward to in life I failed at and feel as thought life is so pointless now considering I have no want or need to ever get into a relationship again. I no longer feel any joy or stress relief from any of my hobbies and just can’t seem to find a reason to keep living when I don’t think I want anything more out of life. I’ve been talking with friends and family about how I feel and its just the same “give it time” but I don’t want to just sit around feeling sad and lifeless for the months to come. I’m in the military all my friends are back home across the world. I dont have any friends here outside of work because I spent and devoted all my free time to my wife or my hobbies which I feel no joy from anymore. So now I feel just so alone in this world and I’m tired of the downs because the ups in life have never really felt worth it. I’ve been on a waitlist for a therapist for three weeks now but if you’ve been in the military you can probably guess how that process goes.

Today is a family members birthday celebration and I’m just finding myself not wanting to be here and just want to go home and be by myself to be miserable. Don’t even want to do anything, just sit and be miserable. Could maybe find something to do but I can’t keep my mind on anything.

I live in my head and it feels like I don’t belong in this world.,0,"It’s like I don’t know how to exist. I have a group of friends I go out with occasionally and a few hobbies and the most loving family that I don’t deserve but I’m never fulfilled. Yesterday I ran out of the house at night because I didn’t want to talk to my parents about “my bad mood lately” and I just don’t know why I did that? I ran around and had a panic attack and my dad called me absolutely screaming and my mom was crying saying why did I do this to them. That they don’t deserve this. 

And they don’t. They’ve never done anything to me but love me. Something is so wrong with me and if there wasn’t I wouldn’t be seeing counsellors to fix me. I hung up on them and realized I didn’t even have anyone else to call because I could never text back or befriend anyone I actually wanted to be friends with. The friends I do have don’t feel real, I can’t connect with them. I get good grades and even the cop who eventually had to come find me said I had a big future ahead of me when he questioned me. What does that mean? I can’t look forward to a life of mediocrity where I work the rest of my life, marry some guy I can’t connect with and have kids who run out in the middle of the night for no reason. 

My beauty exists in my head, she exists in the music and film that I absorb and apply to my life. I feel like I watch everything from inside a shell of myself and if anything slips out it scares everyone off. I can’t make art or even write anymore because I hate it so much. Even in this post, I can’t convey everything in my head and I’m praying it’s not completely non-sensical. I don’t want to hurt myself but everyday I cannot stand waking up and I need an out. 

At the end of the day, I haven’t lived or done any of the things worth living for. I’ve never been to a party and everything that I have smoked I took off of my brother. I had a nicotine addiction last summer that only ended because the disposables I stole burnt up after I recharged them over and over again. For my first kiss I was blackout drunk with these two exchange students in my basement. I barely remember it, don’t even know which one of them I kissed first and we don’t talk anymore. I tried going to the gym and that worked for a bit until my parents began to tag along and I had to coach them through every workout I made because I worry for them. 

I feel plague-ish. I don’t do anything yet I’m regarded as a bad person, possibly for that reason. And I’ve always, always felt like this, though it was so confusing when I was younger. Tomorrow I see a psychiatrist and I’m supposed to start antidepressants if the assessment goes right, but I’m so scared about the possibility that they might make me worse, might make me stop feeling anything that brings me beauty and even that they might work.

Lost in my own mind,0,"For years, I felt a deep painful hole my soul. I've spent thousands of hours in my bed over the last 5 years, just existing. Watching random shit on the internet, consuming worthless goods that give me temporary satisfaction for a few minutes, then I'm back to forcibly distracting my mind.

I feel this empty, grating feeling. I carry it around everywhere I go and it radiates out of my pores, I can't be bothered hiding it anymore. I've tried pretty hard to better myself physically, mentally and spiritually, but I end up in the same pits of despair, continually ruminating on things in the past I can't change, and the future that I'll spend in fear. My mind has been wired in some sort of fucked way, I'm sure about that.

I'm a mess, I'm a lost man with nothing left inside. I crawl up into a ball in my bed, but I never allow myself cry. I won't allow myself to feel love, I run away from the opportunity of forming deep relationships. It's terrifying, the physical manifestation of something which is illusory and transient. Suffering in a self prescribed cell where I torture myself, what is it all for? nothing. My suffering is in vain. You're told to express yourself, but if you do that around the wrong people they'll take advantage of you. If you aren't aware of that, you'll be eaten alive by manipulative cunts. 

I've come to realise, that life is an emotional state. And my emotions are twisted, they're sharp and cut me while giving me nothing of value to hold onto. I feel broken beyond repair, as I've continued on this path of seeking, when I know everything I want comes from within myself.

I fucking despise myself, and the world. I think it's stupid, most people are either braindead or extremely vain/disingenuous. This world rewards narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies, I question why I don't take advantage of this. Because being sensitive and nice has never worked in my favour. It has made me a shell of a person, They say you're loved. yet value you based on looks/money and power. I'm not one of those ""we live in a society"" ppl, but there is definitely some truth to the social and mental programming. My mind has been infected with neural linguistic garbage and false beliefs.

I don't know what to do anymore,1,"I'm just starting to grasp and think in the terms of being depressed, for me and in my experience with people around me depression have always been people being mentally unstable, having panic attacks, crying all night and generally a display of feelings, I'm mostly distanced from feelings and have been thinking that logically there is nothing wrong with me.

Anyway I have a big lack of people to talk to, I always feel seconday among my friends where I really only get a conversation if there is only the two of us, if the group is larger then I never really get much attention or feel like noone cares about what I say.

I have a friend who happen to be the ex of one of my other friends  and we started hanging out after they broke up (my other friend knows and is fine with it).

At the begning things were pretty good but after some time I started noticing some patterns that it was always me that initiated the contact and ask if we should meet. Even talking in chat can be weeks between unless I initiate the contact.

I've asked if we should meet but got told that there was a school assignment that needed focus right now, so I left it. But then I've seen and know that other activities happened during this week.

I'm starting to feel like a pity friend that only good to hang out with when there is litterly no other option availiable, or to get it out of the way if I become to persitant (which I'm not, it is not like I'm asking or talking everyday, just casual).

I know the the mental state is not that good for any of us but I feel bad and sad knowing that I'm not worthy of more attention and I'm thinking of breaking it off...But it is still all that I got.

feels like a lose-lose no matter what I do, when I asked about it basically only got a ""sorry it is me right now, my head is not right etc""

Foe the past few months, at night I wake up in the dark, alone, and just feel paralyzed and crushed by the weight of isolation. I am gripped by the fear that I will never be able to find anyone in this life who understands me. 

Whether platoniclly or romantically, I have no luck. It's been 3 years of being mostly alone. I'm not even sure I can relate to anyone now. I read how people should just be able to happy alone, however I can't. I wonder if that means I'm defective. 

I keep trying to put myself out there, going to events, or taking classes, but nothing works. I'm really losing hope.

"Really struggling with my depression, my doctors, and my relationship",0,"I found a treatment that helped my depression in the past, but my insurance became an issue. I was also trying a new approach with my therapist recently, but then I moved for work and had to stop seeing them. It took ages and a lot of stress to get a new psychiatrist, whose one role in my life is to refill a medication I have taken for years. Last time I spoke with them, they suddenly said they intend to take me off of that medication, although they never previously indicated it would be an issue. I asked what their plan was for replacing it. They said I should keep pursuing the treatment my insurance refused, which I may never be able to restart due to a chronic health issue I have, which nobody bothered to think about until after I got my hopes up because the treatment actually really helped me. I won't know if it's safe for me to continue until/unless I can try it again. There's no timeline in place for that, and that may mean I end up without any kind of medication. They have given me no guidance about how to find a psychiatrist who handles that treatment other than cold calling other doctors and then somehow figuring out how to get them to coordinate with my established doctors and my insurance, which seems completely backward given that I need a referral for everything. It seems like I just need a new psychiatrist altogether, but I don't know how long that will take or if that will mean a lapse in my medication in the meantime.

My relationship also leaves me feeling like I have no control over my life. My partner reacts so harshly if I object to her behaviors, and it prompts hours or even days of (from my end) trying to clarify what I actually said and meant, how I actually feel, that I do not think she is worthless, etc. She vilifies me so much when she's angry, and it has just destroyed my self-worth over the years. I'm just so tired now, and she takes my inability to be endlessly empathic during these cyclical arguments where she tells me how terrible I am as further evidence that I don't care about her. When I've told her how bad it makes me feel when she lashes out like that, the conversation just becomes about how bad she feels because I think she does that. We rarely actually resolve things in the sense of ending up on the same page about what actually happened, what I actually felt, etc. It makes me feel completely alone. If I don't respond how she wants me to, she claims I don't care about her. If I don't apologize for things exactly the way she saw them, it means I don't care about her or my apologies aren't real. If I clarify what I actually said or meant, or correct something about what she claims happened, I'm just making excuses or trying to be right. Evidence of what either of us actually said infuriates her. It feels like the actual words and reality are less important than what she feels is going on.

We argued all weekend about how terrible I make her feel. The issue that started it all was actually that even though we agreed about a certain split in terms of finances, she needs me to abruptly contribute more again without any concrete plans to fix things moving forward, which means delaying various things that need to happen as well as the only thing I have been optimistic about in months. Without a plan, I don't know when she'll be able to stop asking me to pitch in more than what we agreed for this period of time. I had the audacity to be upset about this (by text message, so no body language or tone info), so of course I'm responsible for everything she feels about that and she couldn't possibly just be upset, or reading into things I say, or misinterpreting anything due to her past, which was objectively difficult.

I couldn't talk to my therapist about it before because I assumed they would tell me to leave her. Everything is moving so slowly with new doctors that I don't know when I'll have a new therapist again, but I'm not sure I'll be able to be honest with them about how painful my relationship can be, either.

I don't trust the general relationship subreddits because the advice I see there is usually to just break up with people. Sometimes life is more complicated and people aren't just disposable.

I don't know how to talk to her. I don't know how to navigate the medical system here. I don't know who to talk to who won't just tell me to leave her, like I wouldn't be responsible for anything that happened to her after that. I'm fortunate to have caring family, but if I tell them how much everything sucks, they aren't exactly going to be supportive of the relationship. I'd prefer to hold out in case my partner gets help and figures things out so that she can be a part of my family in the future without extra baggage from this period of our lives. My family members also have their own things going on, and I'd rather they weren't more worried about me.

I'm safe. I'm not going to hurt myself or anything. I'm just really beaten down, and I don't know when it's going to get better.

Does anyone know what’s happening to me?,0,"So I’ve suffered from bi polar depression for a while now (10)yrs. Today I was getting ready for work. I was trying not to be late but I was looking for my tye dye Nike sock to match my tye dye shirt and I was excited about looking sporty decent because I always look like a grown ass man named Gustavo that work on cars. So I could not find the sock and the time is ticking and getting later. Why as an adult did I not make the rational decision to leave and just wear another pair?Why was I infatuated to the point that I spent the next 30-40 mins spiraling? And when I say spin cycle let me explain. So after 7-10 mins of looking in all the places it could be even the dirty clothes I then began to cry hysterically to which I called my boyfriend. I did this because this was the first time we did laundry together and I don’t ever misplace things or leave things in the machine or laundromat. Every other sock I own has a match. When I called him I heard some female speaking in the background to which she coincidentally faded to silence once I started speaking, after hearing that I asked wear he was and he told me he was at work but I found this suspicious because he’s do in at 6 and left to get their at 4 so I kinda made my decision he left to cheat in my head and told him I think we should be friends then hung up. I continued to look for the sock as I cried and thought more negative things about my relationship and self until I figured out the sock was gone. I then put on another pair of socks after having another breakdown and being 45 mins late to work and left.

I want to get help but I'm afraid.,1,"(Burner account since my friends know my main)

So, to begin, I'm afraid of being told I'm overreacting. I'm afraid of being told ""it'll pass"". I'm afraid of being dismissed, as if I say something, I'll get shut down with the argument that others have it so much worse. I feel like I'm being selfish just by thinking of needing help.

I'm aware something is wrong, and has been for a while. Years now, even. I just don't know what. And I don't know what to do. Is it even depression? How can something I can barely abstract from myself even be diagnosed into something so vague? I'm only posting this here because it's the closest my research has landed me to an answer.

I've always felt insignificant. But it's not like I don't have friends, or family, I do - It's just that no matter who I'm with, I've always felt out of place, even as a child. I was always on the quieter side. Still am, even now at University. Always on the side-line, never really there in the moment. I could be downing a whole bottle of wine just to impress a friend and yet in my head I'm miles away, even when sober. Like I'm doing stuff I think they would like just so I know I'm there, in that moment. And as long as I know I'm there, I know I'm alive. That things can change. But they never do.

If this seems disconnected, forgive me, this is more a stream of consciousness I've been wanting to get off my chest for a while. I just don't feel like myself anymore. I've become more irritable, noticeable even to my close friends whom I've accidentally lashed out at a couple times. Selfish as always.

I had a relationship a while back, from December 2020 to July 2022. Looking back, I can confidently say that was the happiest I've been in a long time. But even during that relationship, I felt paranoid. Subtly at first, but enough to arouse suspicion. I felt undeserving of such a wonderful woman, and I realise how fucking selfish that sounds. Selfishness, that seems to be a recurring theme. My overthinking got so bad during lockdown that I would feel ill if I saw her snapscore go up. I was failing my first year of college. Once we were able to meet up again, that subsided a little as college went on as normal and I tried to pull my shit together, eventually passing my exams well enough. We spent a long time together. I genuinely loved her, and I'm sorry I had to taint it. She broke up with me shortly before we left for University. I don't blame her. We'd been drifting apart for a while.

I always felt lonely. Even in the relationship, before and after, and now. Like I said, I have friends. Close friends. My best friend in fact, I know he's going through some tough stuff. Yet he always asks if I'm the one who's okay? I know I'm not a good friend. I've never been good with those conversations. My family kind of bottle our emotions. To further illustrate that, I had a small breakdown after drinking a lot of whiskey on Christmas of 2022. Scared the Hell out of my brother apparently, but I didn't remember any of it. I suppose I should be glad I don't.

When I got to University, things got a lot worse. It's about here that the thoughts of self-harm really started to impact my life. I guess it was a concoction of the stress of moving out, and the workload on top of trying to stay financially stable, all while trying to push myself and meet others. By Autumn of semester 1, I'd already had a belt around my neck twice, but couldn't go through with it. Because I know what an act like that can do to the people who care about me, and I don't want to inflict that suffering on them.

Anyway, I guess I'll end this stream of consciousness here. I just don't know where to go from here. If I sought professional help, what would I even say? What if they see right through me? I want to get better, and I know I can with the right help.

Feeling emotionally numb?,1,"Asking this subreddit because you guys will probably be able to relate the most to what i’m feeling. Saying that I feel emotionally numb wouldn’t even do it justice.

Facility for elderly?,2,"Hi,
My mom (72) has been suffering since the start of this year. She's lost a lot of weight and hasn't had a good night's sleep in months. She was diagnosed with omni-depression (sorry if I misunderstood that).

Last week, at her request, my father checked her into a hospital with a mental health unit, but it was awful for her. It seemed designed for younger people, and people in drug recovery.  They lost her meds once, wouldn't meet her dietary needs, etc. So we checked her out after 48 hours.

We're looking at lots of options to help her, but I was wondering if anyone can recommend an intensive-outpatient, or, if necessary again, an in-patient setting for her in the northern Virginia area? I've done some googling but haven't really found anything great.

Preferably a place for the elderly, or one that's just focused on depression/anxiety. My parents can pay out of pocket, if needed.

A story about a girl.,0,"Well. Here’s a story I want the rest of the people to hear and weigh in on, because I can’t get the clarity or closure myself from this. 

I’m a 24 year old single British man, who has had friends in America since I was a kid. Those friends let me stay and live with them for 6 months in 2020 & 2022. Since first visiting, the idea/notion has been in my head, that I want an American girlfriend. I don’t know why I have this preference as a Brit who lives in England, but I just love the accent, the aspects of their lives, and I seemed to have more luck with them because of my accent. 

Up until this point as well, I’d never had a relationship in England, not even made it past a first date really. It was in feb of 2022 when I was living out on Long Island, I matched with a girl on Hinge  ( Let’s call her Bell) who ticked all my boxes looks wise (as I believe dating apps lean more on looks first) and so we matched and started the conversation. 

Like I said, I’d never had a relationship up until this point. There was one girl in England who I became really heavily into ( I won’t call it love) and she never liked me back, and so a lot of my interactions with girls have been either blunt on their side, or a feeling of nothing is going to happen talking to that one that didn’t like me. Along came Bell, and within the first 2 weeks of talking I experienced what I thought were the first signs of falling in love truly. When we met for the first date, it was something I’d dreamed of before, it couldn’t have gone any better. I had this giddy feeling inside, like I’d known Bell forever, she was everything I was looking for. 

We saw each other for only 3 months. As it progressed, soon came the point of some adult stuff, I ended up taking her virginity. I’d said I wasn’t comfortable doing it unless she was okay with the idea that possibly it won’t work between us in the end, but we agreed to do it anyway as she kinda felt like it was the right time and losing it to a British guy was a little better than a classic douche bag from her area. We kept seeing each other but the pivotal part here is, she lived 2 hours away by train, a journey out to her costing me $50 each time and I wasn’t allowed to work in the US at the time. Of course we met in the city sometimes and she came out to me once, but even the fact it was a 2 hour journey on 2 different trains made it tough. 

It was around the end of April that she texted me saying she wanted to me to spend more time around her friends and family, as it had just been us two going out on dates and stuff. As much as I thought I was ready in that moment to start committing more to her, with travelling more to see her family friends etc, I chose not too and end it with her. My fears of running out of money, her seeing me as a begger and other thoughts got the better of me, and we pretty much just stopped texting by the end of April. I tried to reach out again by the end of may into June and July, but from what I could tell, she already started seeing someone, and didn’t wanna talk to me at all.

In those months of not talking to her, I fell more in love, and realised more what a big fucking mistake I’d made literally throwing the girl of my dreams away because of a 2 hour train ride. As it got to about the end of august I sort of made a last attempt to message her on insta, only to be messaged by her boyfriend telling me I had a chance and lost it. I think I then further pissed her off by trying to get in contact again towards the end of 2022, and I tried asking to talk or get clarity or answers in April of this year, but she just opened the messages ( I have a new and old sc account I messaged her on) and she blocked me on both. 

It’s now May of 2023, a whole year after this event happened to me, and I can still feel myself falling deeper in love with her. I wonder how much longer it’s gonna take me to get over Bell, I hope not long, but because she was everything I wanted and I was the one that screwed it up, my brain is gonna keep bringing it up, and won’t let it go because I just don’t have the answers I want. 

I hope she’ll reach out in the future, for now I’m just waiting around hoping she unblockes me and wants to talk about what happened. What do other people think? Should I give it time before I reach out again? I would like to try and apologise if anything for some of my actions after we stopped seeing each other. Or maybe it’s just time to put the nail in the coffin for good.",13useel,Free-Calligrapher928,1685360255.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13useel/a_story_about_a_girl/,,Depression

when i was a kid the fear of being shouted at grew in me cuz everybody shouted at me , my friends my family my teachers i remember attempting to kms once when i was a kid and my mom didnt care as much she just calmy said put the knife in its place. my mom made me study and study and study and therefore i didnt have time to be friends with anyone. noone wanted to be friends with me because i was ""smart"" and im way out of their league.

rn im 17 i feel like a peice of trash thats spoiled. i dont even know if im really depressed or im just a spoiled brat. i get angry so fast and i always nagnabout everything. i have no one to say these to. i have a girlfriend but if i tell her these things she gets very sad and it just becomes a disaster. i love her so much shes the reason i didnt kms at 15 she supported me so much i feel like shes the only one that loves me truly.

recently i was nagging about how life is shit and i have no luck and other people are way luckier than me so my girlfriend also hears these but she doesnt really say anything. today she was coming from school and she fell and possibly broke her arm .ive never seen her shout at me and swear at me. she told me how im always bitching that im unlucky. 

i just feel so spoiled and garbage. even the one i thought loved me said these things to me. i feel like i deserve nothing. i dont deserve to breathe. my only reason to live was her now that thats happened idk if living is worth it anymore. i havent killed myself yet cuz ik shell be very sad. idk what to do i dont even know if im depressed ro not i dont even know if this is the right subbredit idk anything i just wanted to say these things so i can be empty

Scared,1,My mom passed away last year and it’s the most painful difficult thing I’ve been through. I’m a disabled veteran on a fixed income. My dad had been clean and sober for over 30 years. This happened and everything went downhill. I spent everything I had getting him into a treatment center and he’s barely hanging on. Now I’m alone and all my monthly bills are due. I’m ruined and have nowhere to turn. I want to just give up but I promised my mom before she passed that I would NEVER do anything to hurt myself. I’m wondering if she would understand what I’m going through now and understand why I’m not wanting to be feeling like this anymore. I am not built to live on the streets. It’s just me and my little miniature wiener dog who depends on me and I love her so much. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long rant here.

Feeling a bit like an impostor in depression,5,"Yesterday I started wondering if I really was depressed. Maybe I'm not actually: maybe I'm just a bad, boring, lazy person, who sleeps a lot - and who finds depression to be a convenient excuse for all their weaknesses.  
A friend asked me if I was 'sad', and I realised I could truthfully answer 'no'. I'm not sad, I'm just empty and filled with contempt. I associate sadness with feeling alive - you have to care about things to be sad. I just don't want to do anything, I don't want to try anymore. But maybe I just find it easier to say that I'm depressed than to explain that I've basically given up, that I just want to drink, sleep and watch TV. Or maybe those are the same thing?

I genuinely hate people,2,"DNI if you are sensitive to mentions of people hating you, light mentions of sui, and light mentions of harm to others. 

&#x200B;

I really really hate people. Really. I don't even know who to specifically hate at this point because there is practically no one on earth who is loveable. I'm obviously a shitty person for saying this but at this point I even starting to  hate my 1 year old brother (albeit barely as much as everyone else) cause I know he'll turn out to be like my Jesus fanatic parents. I hate my friends too cause they're just obnoxious at times, and they can't tell when I'm socially drained (nor would they care or take it lightly). I hate my teachers cause they're all crap, and I feel like they won't care at all if I just disappeared. My family is a lost cause lmao, my brother got mad at me after I told him God wasn't real and started mentioning Elijah. Wouldn't of been a big deal except it was right after my family did an exorcism on me cause they found my equipment I used/was gonna use for a suicide attempt. And don't get me started on the rest of humanity, cause at this point we're just a lost cause. Bigots everywhere I turn, people just proving to me that we're a terrible species. Canada is turning into the US in terms of trying to eradicate my existence and just generally making it unbearable to live here. And people genuinely don't get me or my thought process. At this point I've given up on trying to please everyone, since I know that no one will be able to get it. I feel like there s no point n even trying cause being alive here requires me to interact with people in some way. I've had violent intrusive thoughts related to this (which I won't mention in detail cause the psych ward sucks imo), but at this point I know that mass unalive won't solve anything. I'll much rather kill myself than interact with another person. I just hate humanity with a passion.

"On paper my life is pretty good. I have friends, a career, achievements in my field, I’m respected in my community, hobbies, I lost 60lbs recently, and I’ve never been so depressed. If it weren’t for my wife and kids, I don’t know what I’d do. Posting this for myself. I just need to say it.",2,"Seriously, I don’t know what’s wrong with me lately. I feel ridiculously ungrateful, especially when reading other people’s problems. But I’m so miserably on a daily basis. When I’m with my children I am happy a majority of the time. But in almost every other circumstance, I am not. I feel alone, frustrated, and like I’m just going through the motions of life. If I don’t do those other things though, then I can’t make money to live the life I really want to live, which is really just be a nerd and a dad. 

There was a period of time when I was part of a federal trial and thought I was going to jail. I thought this for 5 years, and my attorney said it was a very real possibility. In that time I started a new career, had kids and bought a home. I was very depressed obviously, thinking that my life would be behind bars for something I know I didn’t do but couldn’t prove, but I was able to mentally get passed it and do a few great things. This time is different. I’m like next level void of motivation and the lust for life. 

I have to be on social media for work, and I hate it. I can’t help but compare myself to other people and it’s destroying my self esteem. I also feel lost in every group I am a part of. I’m a very sociable and confident and well-liked, but I attract business power-suit types. If that’s you, no offense, but it’s not me. I wanna talk about some comic books, magic the gathering, Star Wars, LOTR type shit and they wanna talk about football and crypto. And people with similar interest don’t wanna be friends with me. Idk why specifically, but also I just don’t have the time to explore making a whole new group of friends as an adult. 

Also where I live is very diverse culturally, but the majority is still white. As I move up the social ladder, that ratio feels like it’s shifting more and more. My spouse is white as well, and I obviously love her and married her and had kids. But I’m a child of divorce with a mom, and a brother half my age that didn’t grow up with me and it’s just us. My wife comes from a tightly knit squad of a family. Including aunts, uncles, grandparents and first cousins, there are (without exaggeration) 80+ of them locally. And they’re all white as well, which occasionally, makes me feel out of place. Not by default, but when certain comments are made or political views are brought up or some of the previous generation talks about how “things are changing”. There are other differences too but I won’t go into it, but essentially it feels like everything is always a bunch of people to 1, and I’m alone in my beliefs. 

I also can’t stand the online community’s mob mentality. I understand the irony of complaining about it and then posting here, but I need to get this out and be honest. I feel like there are genuinely good people out there, but then there are a bunch of people deluding themselves into thinking they’re good people because they like cats and memes. I’m not saying I’m a saint, but I don’t go around saying “I’m a saint.” Toxic positivity is one of the things slowly grating at me daily. And politics.. the focus on political issues is unreal. It’s inescapable. everyone thinks they’re so smart. any idiot with a keyboard can give the most obvious, unoriginal, bandwagon opinion and get glorified for it online. And it bothers me in all those ways- the stupidity, the fakery, the adoration, all of it. And therein lies my biggest problem I think- the relationship between the perceived importance of internet popularity and self worth. 

I cannot avoid it. I am surrounded by it and it’s killing me. Facebook, Instagram, reddit, Imgur - I hate them but I can’t stop. And slowly it’s chipping away at my mind and spirit. 

Idk, I also get mad at injustice. And the whole “feeling alone in all of my circles” thing also gets to me on the daily. Idk.. I just hate it all.",13uoege,NeverSleepsNow,1685346887.0,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uoege/on_paper_my_life_is_pretty_good_i_have_friends_a/,,Depression

I use to have goals and ambition in my life. But it is just died after my mother passed away. All my life my only goal was to make her happy in the end provide for her take care for her.

Everything is obsolete now. I am detached. I don't have gf neither I need one, I use to believe in true love but now I don't believe in that too. Not like I got heartbroken or anything but when I see around I don't see the ideals when I moulded into by my mom. Sometimes I want to leave everything and become a monk.

Im suic*dal and been doing s3lf h4rm. But most of the time I’m okay and i feel like okay. She said episodes will come through stages, first anxiety then panic attacks then whole sht episode.

I’ve quit my medicine and it feels like a veil has been lifted.,0,"Hey everybody. I’ve struggled with depression for around 5 years, the first year or two I didn’t know what was going on then made my way to a doctors and figured out my ailment. They put me on antidepressants of various flavours and after a bit of trial and error I ended up on max dose mirtazepene. Sertraline was an interesting one, it made it so that I couldn’t…. You know… come to a resolution 😂

I’d been getting noticeably better in the last 6 months, not perfect but better. The bad days were being outweighed by the good days at last but still I wasn’t winning. I’d still find myself feeling lonely (I have a wife and two children) constantly, waking up in the morning dreading the day ahead. There’s nothing wrong with my life, financially I’m ok, my relationship is wonderful and my job is mostly good. But the cloud was still casting a shadow on everything so I kept taking my medicine without thinking about it.

Anyway a couple of months ago we had a little family break, just a few days away across the country and whilst we were there I forgot to take my medicine for a few days, I’ve been very zealous with my medicine and taking it every day as prescribed since being on it.

Not 2 days into not having my medicine I had more energy and most importantly I had sexual desire flowing through me like the old days. I’ve always been a high libido kind of guy but that side of me had just vanished over the years. I put it down to getting older and or my condition. But it was such a weird feeling to just be me again And having these desires which I thought had long gone.

So when I got home I lowered my dose, taking half a tablet every other day and a full tablet the days between just to take it slow. Then half tablets every day, then a half tablet every 2 days. Then around a week ago I thought screw it, I’m just not taking it anymore.

The first glaringly obvious effect is that I can’t sleep, I’ve been awake from 3am for most of this week now and although come 5pm I’m absolutely wiped out, the rest of the days have been astonishing. Woke up at 4 this morning, no chance of getting back to sleep so just head downstairs to have a few coffees and enjoy some quite time before everyone wakes up.

I was literally skipping into work the other day even after 3 hours sleep and a 10 hour shift ahead of me. I’ve been play fighting with my kids, laughing with my wife, cuddling with my dog, thinking about stuff we can do to our house and having some very romantic coitus with my wife. I’ve honestly not been this genuinely happy for years.

I’m well aware that things could slide, my sleep may take a toll on my physical health or come winter I might be back to square one. But for now I’m just so glad that I’m back. It’s ME here and not the shelled out body that I have been for the last 5 years. I could cry at the thought of my time lost with my children but I’ve tried my hardest the whole time and now that I can finally see again I’m going to make the most of it.

I’m not advocating anybody to simply stop taking their meds, what works for me might not work for you but I’m just so amazed at the difference in my mentality that I just had to share.

I am Scared,0,"I was shaken as an infant, and because of this my neurological health is in a perpetual downward projection. My first symptoms were difficulty with fine motor skill, sensations feeling detached, a difficulty getting my thoughts into words, restless leg syndrome, intense insomnia and neurons overfiring, TMJ, etc. As time has gone on, my health has gotten worse, I started developing mental fog, pain and trembling in extremities, loss of gross motor skills, ambient pain, headaches at the most extreme end pain wise and lasting months on end, slurred speech and wordsalads, intense pain in muscle regions, inability to distinguish smells, ocassional black outs, etc. Just recently ive realized that my face muscles hurt and tremble a lot, and I am scared, because if at 27 these are health conditions i already experience, i dont want to imagine how much worse itll get, even with treatment from my neurologist it has only slowed down at the most minimal amount.

It’s getting bad again,0,"I really feel like I got the short stick of things when it comes to my mental health genetics. 

I just got back from a 3 week solo trip in Europe and it was amazing, I met so many people and had so many experiences. I know I thrive off of human interaction, but when I am home I have pretty bad social anxiety and tend to isolate myself due to depression. When I’m traveling I’m just too distracted to even feel depressed and i genuinely feel happy and fulfilled. 

I got back like 6 days ago (was bawling as I was leaving) and I’ve progressively just gone back to how I felt before the trip. I find myself isolating myself again. I only snapchat a few people and i find myself not opening their snaps for longer. I don’t have any friends here (in the US where I live) and everyone I met abroad lives in either a different country or a state super far away. 

Work is not helping, I didn’t realize how triggered I get by customers and my coworkers, like it feels like a place that just doesn’t understand me. I’ll wake up in a good mood only for work or dumb customers to completely ruin it. When I’m traveling things make sense. Nothing makes sense when I’m home. 

I know a big part of that is not having meaningful relationships, i don’t even speak to my family. I have no support system. My self esteem surprisingly lowers each day that I’m back in the US, and I didn’t realize how bad it was. My eating disorder comes back and the only thing that provides me any comfort is food. 

I just feel like I don’t know how much longer I can keep going. I’m not rich enough to just quit my job and travel forever, I have responsibilities and I’m starting my masters in the fall (and working). I just feel so devastated like I hate that I went from being a social butterfly to being isolated once again. I can’t bring myself to try to make friends or to go on dates. When I got back I felt motivated for a couple days, like I could get myself on track, but the more I’m isolated and the more I keep getting triggered at work the less motivated I feel. I suddenly just want to again spend every day alone in my room, even though I know it’s making it worse. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no one. I wish I felt more motivated, and it sucks knowing that there are people out there who naturally just want to go and make friends and do and don’t really think about it. Or people who just have fulfilling lives day-to-day when they’re not traveling or doing crazy things. I just feel like life is harder for me and I didn’t ask for this. When will it just end? It feels like torture. It feels like my youth is just going to waste.

My mom threatend to get rid of my puppy,0,"My parents are going through a messy divorce and I have cut off contact with my father. My mom only got the divorce after I became suicidal because of my dad’s abuse and his molesting me. Even after I was depressed and asking for a psychiatrist she never belived me and brushed me off treating me like I was dramatic and stupid. It was only until I started cutting myself did she do anything. Since then I’ve asked her to trust me and not brush me off next time I try ti tell her something. And shees said she would listen and whatever, but she hasn’t. At all . She always brushes me off whenever I suggest anything and she meets it with negativity and belittling me and brushing me off and minimizing what I’m saying. Until it’s too late. We brought home a new puppy a couple weeks ago and I told her she needed a vet appointment because that’s the only logical thing to do with a new animal. And she brushed me off and gave me all the reason I was wrong.  Now since we didn’t, the puppy brought giardia into the house and mites. And it’s too late almost. I spent 5 hours cleaning the house and we have two other dogs that could have gotten it. I now have mite bites all over my legs and told my mom u wanted to go to a doctor, and she brushed me off AGAIN saying to just take a bath . And gave me all the reasons why that was dumb. I had an argument with her about this behavior and she said she was listening to me , and I used the puppy’s vet appointment as an example, at the end of the argument she was blaming me for dragging it on because she said “sorry” but at the end when I knew I hadn’t gotten anywhere. She said she understands, then looked at me and said maybe we should get rid of the puppy. “I’m too overwhelmed”. I’m the one taking care of the puppy alll day every day while my moms at her 9-5 . She has no part in looking after the dog and she has no right being overwhelmed by it and threatening ti take aaay the dog to what?! Make me not fight with her anymore?! I’m so angr idk what to feel . How do I deal with her if she won’t listen to me?

i just recently started trying to get up and do something (i.e. exercise), but since my stomach started hurting, i no longer feel comfortable doing so. all i can think about is how my stomach hurts and how irritated i am about it. i’ve took over-the-counter medication to no avail, which is around the time i realised that it might be a byproduct of how sad and stressed i am all the time.

When attractive people say they have it hard...,3,"99 percent of attractive people on my college campus have lifestyles straight out of a Hollywood movie. I sincerely admire how they can keep a straight face while complaining that one of their many partners assuming they sleep around made them ""depressed."" Meanwhile, I was literally willing to get alcohol poisoning and almost die to experience just a little sympathy from some party-goers for once in my whole life.
  
You know what would make a good reality show? If we took these cupcakes who have never felt real pain in their whole lives and complain about people only liking them for their looks and not their even better personalities or people being jealous and put them in an ugly, socially impaired person's life. Have them be completely starved of all social validation, sex, love, and relationships they can't even go a full week without for maybe 20 or so straight years, or however many minutes they last before jumping in front of a train.

I seem to be a magnet for bad luck even though I try to.l be as positive as I can be…,1,"I’ve seen countless of posts like this but they all seem to be years old.

Just like the title says, all beg/negative things happen to me. It’s the stupid little things, like missing the bus, taking the wrong bus, stuttering a little, bumping into things, dropping things. 

I’m currently on vacation with someone (for the first time). I’ve learned through this trip that she is not a true friend and just someone I wouldn’t want to vacation with ever again. She also seems to be getting into amazing events meanwhile o stay in the hotel room or go to my 2 events I have booked. And I get it, “speak up” or “book events”. But it’s hard to explain without going into detail about this. 

She will show off about the things she’s done or just leave without saying anything to me. So I have no choice but to be on my own. Which I always am in general at this point. Sometimes I feel like I’m the problem, even though I feel her attitude towards me. I usually keep things to myself because I am a true believer that if I “show off” my luck runs out (because it has happened countless of times). Yet more amazing things happen to her without a problem.

To be honest I don’t even know what I am asking for. I guess I just needed a place to vent. Or if anyone has tips on how to stop feeling less about myself(especially when my friend makes me feel like that most of the time)

I’d also like to point out that I have social anxiety and am a true introvert. (My friend too is an introvert, if anyone cares to know). This trip in general is extremely out of my comfort zone.

Não estou aguentando mais!!,0,"
Opa eae pessoal!!
Coloquei esse título porque não estou mesmo aguentando mais…
 Tudo começou em 2017, minha família era muito feliz tínhamos muito dinheiro e sempre em comunhão, eu namorava uma menina na época, até hoje amo ela; mais de repente as coisas começaram a ficar estranhas…
 
Minha mãe começou a brigar muito com meu pai, e ninguém sabia o porque, mais eu sabia; meu pai tinha traído minha mãe. Descobri pois um dia meu pai me levou para assistir um filme no cinema, e eu vi ele mandando mensagem para uma mulher que não era minha mãe, mais ainda podia piorar!!
 
 Meu pai estava traindo minha mãe, com a mãe da minha namorada. Então a família descobriu e tudo começou a desabar
 
Meu pai foi embora com a minha namorada, e coma mãe dela. E nos abandonou sem nada, sem onde morar, começamos a morar de favor, moramos de favor em duas cidades diferentes!
 
Ainda tentava manter um relacionamento com a minha namorada, mais estávamos muito abalados com oque aconteceu, mais ainda continuávamos a conversar, falar que um dia ficaríamos de novo, mas não foi bem assim!
 
Sempre que um de nós tínhamos uma crise de ansiedade, ligávamos um para o outro.Até que um belo dia ela me falou, “seu pai foi embora, ele não está mais morando com nós!!”

 Isso foi um choque pois achei que ele voltaria, mais não ele não voltou a morar com a nossa família. Então minha mãe começou a seguir a vida dela, começou a namorar meu padrasto (muito gente boa ele!!) e meu pai mais uma vez, voltou a morar, com a mãe da minha namorada! 
  
Mais ele estava falando para a mãe dela para de dar atenção para ela, e ela fez isso, começou a dar mais atenção ao meu pai; então ela me ligou um dia, querendo desabafar, mais eu tinha conhecido uma menina muito legal, e ignorei a ligação dela. Por conta dessa falta de atenção e contato, eu e a mãe dela estávamos se distanciando dela!!
 
Então ela tomou uma decisão de se MATAR, pois a mãe dela tinha também brigado feio com ela, isso foi dia 4 de março de 2020 e esse dia demorou séculos para passar, pensei em fazer a mesma coisa mais não conseguia nem me mexer!!

Vou parar um pouco aqui mais se quiserem a pt 2 curtam e comentem!

My letter to the world. Farewell.,3,"My name is M. I’m just leaving a final note here and going to write some personal letters before taking my own life tomorrow. 

I believe I have the method I want to do it with and I’m sure I’ll be successful. I’ve flirted with the idea of suicide for 10 years and never did. It’s time to be happy now. 

A big part of this is my narcissist soon to be ex wife. She got pregnant and screwed many people while married to me and blamed me and said I was abusive. She got pregnant by a drug dealer and chose him over me. Threw me in the trash can. Laughs at my pain and suffering. Humiliated me as a man and a father. Triangulates. Says I abused her. All lies. I hope she goes to hell and her pregnancy fails. I don’t give a shit. She did me horribly after my dad died. 

I’ve been living in a fucked up house since she left as I lost my mind and mental health. I have no running water in my house. Haven’t showered in days. Barely ate. Today I had a McDouble. 

I have a job offer for 60k but can’t make it to the finish line because I’m depressed, starving, and they just repo’d my car. How can you even focus when you’re hungry and can’t even shower. I’ve showered for a month with a sink at the park. 

I just wanna say thanks to you dad in Heaven for always guiding me. I wanna see you tomorrow. So I will spare this cause we shall meet soon and catch up. 

Mom: Love hate relationship with you. You are a good lady and piss me off at the same time. I wish you would calm the hell down. 

Son: You are my Angel and you don’t know how much you mean to me. You will not be okay with your narcissist mother but I hope when you grow up you follow Islam properly and be a good Muslim and God will help you have a good life. I wish I could withstand poverty and these living conditions more but I can’t. And I can’t stand your mom. She did so much evil and damage to our family and has paid no consequences for it. She’s living as though nothing happened. A complete psychopath. You deserve way better baby. I love you and always will. I will watch you from Heaven. As I am meeting my dad you know we will see each other one day and when we do I am gonna give you a big hug and kiss as usual. 

As for the rest of humanity: fuck you. You were cruel to me and 99% bastards from hell. As for the good people in the 1%, thank you. May God bless you. 

To confirm my faith I died as a Muslim. I believe Allah is God and Muhammad is his messenger and Jesus was just a Messenger. He was not divine in any way. Allah is divine alone and worthy of all worship. I am a Muslim and would like to be buried as one. 

I don’t wanna leave but my conditions forced me. There’s no help. There’s nothing but suffering. And I choose not to suffer with this shit anymore.

Felling like zombie on Zoloft and other SSRI's,2,"Hello. Im 31yo male who has been suffering from depression, generalized anxiety and social anxiety. I've been taking Lexapro 10-20-5mg (1 year), then Trazadone 50-100mg (5 days), now Zoloft 50mg (8 weeks)
All of these eliminated depression immediately but did not help with anxiety. Zoloft kind of helps with mental anxiety but makes body anxiety worse. I am however feeling worse then on Lexapro on this one due to these side effects:
- emotional numbness 
- lack of energy
- lack of any motivation 
- laziness 
- much less productive at work
- oversleeping
- even more antisocial than without it
- not answering phone or replying to anyone
- cant start or keep conversation
- would just sit on the couch and play phone games
- low libido and hard time ejaculating
- weird sensation in jaw when yawning or orgasming
- not sure if it's just a coincidence but I am feeling an itritable scratching sensation in my thtoat and nose

I feel like my body is telling me to stop taking this medication. 
I honestly felt better without any drugs even with depression, since I had moments of euphoria or motivation. Alcohol helped with socialization and at least I could have fun. On these meds alcohol are just making me drowsy and that's it :D

I talked to my psychiatrist who prescribed Trentillex but it is not covered by my insurance so he switched it to Effexor XR but I am reading a lot of side effects on this one.

Aside from help with depression and anxiety, I would like to achieve high energy, less sleep, more motivation, no brain fog, more socialization.

Would you recommend giving Effexor a try or suggesting my doctor something else? 

I was thinking about adding Wellbutrin to either Zoloft or Lexapro. What do you think?",13uk152,PossibilityFree5261,1685332266.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uk152/felling_like_zombie_on_zoloft_and_other_ssris/,,Depression

It sucks having depression and anxiety,7,"You think that no one cares about you, that no one wants to hear what you want to say or do. It has you think about suicide so many times, then when you try to talk about it to someone they don’t understand. I’ve been to a hospital and some people in my life still don’t understand my feelings. To be honest, I thought killing myself would finally get people to listen, like I’m worth more dead than alive. Also, despite wanting social interactions…I get scared, I want to leave and just disappear out of no where and believe that no one would care anyway. It’s so difficult sometimes. Sometimes I still think eventually I’ll give in and commit suicide…we will see but hopefully it won’t come to that. 

Currently the only thing that’s giving me comfort somewhat is music. I don’t know if anyone will read this, you don’t have to.

So tired of losing potentially great relationships because of my emotions.,0,"See title. Was in a great Discord group with awesome people, got along with some of them extremely well. Then the other day, I just... felt like I didn't belong anymore. It was completely unreasonable and lacking logic, but I left the group instantly. I messaged the person who initially brought me into the group, telling her I was leaving just so that somebody would know. She responded with what I perceived to be a very disconnected, insincere response and it hurt so much. She was the one I thought I got along with the best, so to be dismissed like that really hit me. We talked a little longer, and I lashed out a bit because of a perceived slight that wasn't even really there most likely. I upset her, and feel so fucking terrible about it. She's always been friendly and welcoming. She didn't deserve that. I sent her one last message today apologizing for what I did, as it was inexcusable and that I'd like to remain friends if she is willing. I haven't even bothered to check if she responded. I'm too scared to see what she says. Why do I always do this to myself? I've self-sabotaged so many friendships just because I feel like I don't deserve them. So many amazing people I cared about deeply. Gone. I'm so tired of it.

"I’m unsure how to pick myself up again, consistently.",1,"Do you ever feel like if you stop and rest, you won’t get back up again?

Like, it’s either a million miles a minute or nothing at all? 

And i dont know why i feel this way. Maybe i go a million miles for a million reasons. I’m scared of missing out, there’s not enough time…. But also, because I’m scared that as soon as I rest, I’ll lose all my motivation. 

And i lose my motivation because… sometimes I feel like there’s nothing to work towards. There’s nothing worthy of my time and energy. Or that no matter how much I do it will never be enough. That, and also, im generally lost in life. And im scared of failing. I dont know which direction to go and im too scared to stick to one thing because that could lead me no where.


So instead I lay here on the couch all weekend. Eating. Feeling so anxious. But having no courage to get up and go out, or to get up and go work. And i tell myself that it’s okay because it’s my rest time, but it’s not rest, it’s fear. Fear of not doing enough at work. At life. And that fear and anxiety is so crippling that it makes me not want to take a single step forward.

Sometimes if I do a thing here or there, like going on a walk or doing a household chore, I feel a sense of hope and motivation, and that lasts about 5 minutes before I find myself back on the couch where it’s safe and no one can tell me what to do.",13uiu7x,Ok_Object_5763,1685328709.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uiu7x/im_unsure_how_to_pick_myself_up_again_consistently/,,Depression

Really not coping at the minute UK,1,"
I've had PTSD since I was an early teen due being a young carer to my grandparents one had lung cancer. And other I witnessed falling down the stairs and becoming completely paraplegic from the neck down  (still can tell you the exact time and Day/date) it happened even after 20 odd years. Not long after they passed myself and my mother moved away from current location to near London things were going well down there till my 3 older sisters convinced my mum to move back to the original town which we did .they promised a lot of things helping out etc etc. But never delivered


So the last few years my mums health has declined and has steadily go worse having being diagnosed with heart problems and diabetes retinopathy of her legs (basically nerve damage) so shes pretty much losing the ability to use her legs. So I've had to become a carer again and look after her. All by myself as the other 3 supposed sisters haven't bothered they all live within 5/10 mins of drive 2 of them we haven't seen or heard from in over 3 years and one only comes around when she wants something.

Roll on to December last year the company Im employed by made a few of us redundant due to cost cutting measures all right before Christmas aswell .
They asked me to stay on an ad-hoc basis and if things changed back to the way they were I'd be back up to usual hours 60+ a week were ok but work got less and less and now I've not had anything for 2 months.Ive tried looking for some more work but nothings been successful on top of that landlord that we were renting off filed for eviction due to government changing the way rentals are done (tenancy agreement)  so we ended up being evicted he also disposed of everything we owned he gave us only 7 days to move our stuff out so literally have nothing to our names. We've tried everything to get a house somewhere else but everyone's in same boat in the rental sector more demand than property. Our local authority says we don't qualify for housing but they've put us in a 1 bedroom (flat/apartment) as emergency temporary accommodation till we can get something sorted but it's not going great.

On April 14th I lost my oldest friend (Labrador) had him nearly 15 years.

I was just about coping till Saturday morning when my mum collapsed in my arms had to first aid etc and ring an ambulance and she's still in hospital not doing too well.

To top it all off the last couple of days I've had a large  mass in my lower left side of stomach and pain but can't get sorted till my mums ok .

Feeling Burnt Out and Struggling with Depression: My Journey Towards Becoming a Psychotherapist,3,"Hello fellow Redditors :)  
  
I (30F) recently went through one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. For weeks, I found it nearly impossible to get out of bed, go to work, or even function properly. It got so bad that I had to seek help at a hospital about a month ago. On the surface, everything seems great—I'm a Learning Support teacher and currently studying to become a psychotherapist. But internally, I'm constantly battling burnout and feeling like my depression is dragging me further away from my dreams.  
  
To add to the mix, I'm about to start a practicum at a Mental Health unit in a hospital, which is ironic considering I was in one just four weeks ago. The fear of how my mental health will hold up during this time is a constant source of worry. However, this past week has been relatively better, which gives me a glimmer of hope.  
  
Right now, I'm contemplating whether I should reduce my course load next semester. Instead of taking on three subjects, I'm considering scaling it back to just one. The problem is, this would extend the duration of my course by another year. I genuinely want to become a therapist, but my depression keeps throwing obstacles in my path, making it incredibly frustrating.  
  
Should I keep pushing myself to meet my original goals and potentially surprise myself, or should I take a slower, more manageable pace? The latter option makes me feel like a failure, settling for just enough money to get by without a partner or a solid career at the moment. It's disheartening to think that my depression is pushing my dreams further out of reach.  
  
I'm reaching out to you, Reddit, because I'm curious if any of you have experienced something similar. Have any of you faced burnout and struggled with depression while pursuing a career in the mental health field? How did you manage to navigate through it all? Did you choose to push through and surprise yourself, or did you take a slower, more self-care-oriented approach?  
  
I must admit, my therapist's comment about not wanting to prolong my degree upset me. But perhaps there's wisdom in their words that I'm failing to see. I would greatly appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or insights you could share with me.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read and respond. Your support means the world to me.  
  
TL;DR: I'm a Learning Support teacher and aspiring psychotherapist who recently went through a severe depressive episode. Despite everything looking good from the outside, I constantly battle burnout and fear that my depression is hindering my dreams. Facing a decision to take a slower pace or push through, I'm seeking advice from those who have been through similar experiences. Share your insights, personal stories, and guidance, as it would be greatly appreciated.",13uffcq,Zestyclose-Increase1,1685318995.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uffcq/feeling_burnt_out_and_struggling_with_depression/,,Depression

Another one of my plans go cancelled,5,"I haven't been dressed properly for months so when plans get made, even weeks ahead i look forward to it. My sister and dad promised to drive to Ikea and i've been waiting for around four weeks for us to go there, but last minute my sister decides to cancel. 

I don't go alone with my dad because he hasn't been there for me and he's just a really quiet and awkward person so i don't feel comfortable to go alone with him. That's why i wanted my sister there. This is like the sixth time she cancelled plans with me.

The thing I don't understand,2,"When I was in therapy, my therapist used to point out that people who had left, such as my ex, didn't care about me and likely never did. 

I see people say things like this a lot and that it helps them feel better. I don't understand. That's what hurts, isn't it? My therapist said I had an ego problem, because I couldn't deal with someone not liking me anymore, or the fact that I was wrong about them actually liking me in the first place.

I don't know what to do with that. I wish I understood how normal, healthy, people thought because what helps them apparently is what just hurts me.",13ueodv,ThrowAway4Venti,1685317079.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ueodv/the_thing_i_dont_understand/,,Depression
Depression feels more comfortable than 'normal' does,2,"By normal I mean putting on a happy face, being positive in general, having hope in myself and people around me... except it doesn't feel right. It's like living a lie. Every time I try to be happy, I reflect on what I've lost over all these years and the pain is so real, so much more than the fleeting happiness that means no more than episodes of escape from reality. Pain stays. Being depressed is my way of coping with losses that will always be part of me. I remember.

"my prom, a night to remember, but not for good reason.",2,"for my senior night at prom, i took this girl i knew for a while(5-6 years), sometimes we would be on and off “talking” but we were always honest and there for each other, and i thought we had hit it off this night. I knew she still had feelings for an ex, who was her first for everything, but she was telling me that they didn’t talk like that anymore and to not worry about him. i asked multiple times what the situation was and she told me that him and her weren’t like that. we facetimed and talked all week before prom and the day of prom i take her home. i get ready for a great night, my mom drives me to this place to take pictures where we meet her. She looked beautiful. I mean beautiful. I put the corsage around her wrist and then we started walking to nice areas to take pictures. after we were done my mom drove the both of us to prom. it started off really good, we took a bunch more pictures of me and her and me and my friends. we then sat down at are table and the time passes by. We eat, then we go to dance with everybody, this was the most fun i had for as long as i can remember. During the hype song’s obviously i would get hype with my friends, but for the spanish and love songs me and her would dance. We were on the dance floor for a while, sometimes taking breaks to go outside and catch our breath or going to get a drink of water. more than half way through the night, a slow song was playing, my hands around her waist and her hands around my neck, i look at her straight in the eyes and start to smile, i slowly pulled her in, she said to me “is this really what you want?” I smirked and nodded my head and we kissed for the first time. little did i know that this would ruin our friendship forever. she goes to tell her friend whatever she thought while me and my best friend went to get water while we talked about what me and her did. At this point i’m so happy. then we come back and the next song comes on. we kiss again, and then the next song, again, and the next song, we kissed, again. The very last song of the night plays, it’s a slow one. the whole song i looked right into her eyes, at the very end of the song everybody around me kissed and so did we. I thought this was a great night, one to remember. I bring her home and everything seems fine. I wake up the next morning, she was acting weird, she turned off her location and was dry snapping me. I gave her space because I thought doing so would give her time to clear her mind. I find out the next night she’s at her exes house in his bed. The worst part about it is, after i found out she kept apologizing, saying she was sorry and that she wouldn’t do anything to hurt you. I asked her 3 simple questions. Did the kiss mean anything to her, does she have feelings for me, and did she regret it. she answer question 2 and 3 honestly. “I don’t have feelings for you, i never did, because i still love him. Yes i do regret it because now we’re in this position.” I’ve been throughout many heartbreaks, i’m a lover boy. But man, when i tell you this one hurt the most it fucking hurt. I’ve never cried to my parents over any of the people in the past that i have talked to. But this one man. Oh boy. She played a big part in my life for some of these years too, so to have to unadded her on everything hurts, and it may not hurt her at all but man as my friend and when she was more than my friend, She meant a whole fucking lot to me bro. Why would she lie to me? Why am i not enough? these are the questions i ask myself. Why would she kiss me? If something like this has happened with you of any sort, i just want you to know that i feel your pain, and most likely people won’t see this and that’s okay but if someone is out there hurting i just want you to know we’re in this together, everything happens for a reason, i love you and so do many others. goodbye.",13uel3z,ReadySandwich7450,1685316847.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uel3z/my_prom_a_night_to_remember_but_not_for_good/,,Depression

I feel like I beat my anxiety just to slip into depression and I don’t know what to do,0,"I used to struggle really badly with social and generalized anxiety which I am happy to say I have made incredible strides in overcoming. I am able to do things now socially and just in my day to day life that I previously wished I could. I am very proud of myself, I did this with the assistance of medication and I did take a lot of steps out of my comfort zone then that have helped. However, I am not doing very well right now, and my anxiety is not at fault for that. 
 
I just genuinely feel sad and tired of everything. I know I have done everything I could think of but I’m just in a bad situation stuck in a place where I am surrounded with fake people who I cannot relate with, my friends make me feel worthless sometimes and I feel I have so much to prove to everyone but they just can’t see. I am batshit in love with someone I know, the only person I feel connect to, and I have spent the past two years letting myself be completely destroyed by them and all the mixed signals they send me. I’ve done everything I could for them, and they make me feel terrible sometimes, but they’re the only person I love and I can’t get over them because I would feel so void without feeling this connection to someone and I wouldn’t have anyone. I love all the hope it gives me, laying in bed and going through my day daydreaming about being close to them and how good things could be but as time goes on the more of a pipe dream that becomes and it destroys me. I have done everything I can to relate to people around me but for the life of me I can’t. I am watching the smartest, most supportive person in my life slowly losing a battle with a terrible incurable condition, I have to deal with knowing in the back of my mind that my generation is fucked so badly, I have to face the fear everyday that i might never meet my people,even if it’s not true, I have to put on a face for all my colleagues and be a goof so they never see how shitty I feel even though I know they won’t care. 

I’m transferring schools next year (thank fuck) and I hope that makes things better, but in the meantime I need to make a change. I don’t want to be lonely and depressed this summer or anymore because I really can’t take it. Sometimesafter a hard day I’ll just sit in bed at night and cry so fucking hard about everything. I was so happy when I was living in hope all the times thinking that all of my small goals would be accomplished by now but I saw their candles be blown out. My big passions are music and working out and they help a lot in the moment, but I can’t be doing them 24/7 time yknow and it doesn’t change all the shit I’ve been through. I don’t have the motivation to do my work,I can’t go to therapy because I have tried before multiple times and I’ve never met the right therapist and it’s exhausting to keep going to people and dumping all of my problems out, and I live in the US so it’s expensive as fuck. please help me, I’ve fought the boss of anxiety but now I’m getting kicked in the balls all over again. I’m not going to end my life, I can’t and I promise my self I never will.

My sister said she’s going to Jill herself,0,"… and I don’t know what to do. 

My sister was just washing up, I had told her I would stay up with her (it being 11pm) while she finishes … but I saw my computer was dying and tomorrow I have to wake up early for a hair appointment so I said I wanted to go and she joking said “no don’t go someone might kill me” and I said “stfu how likely is it for someone to kill you” she’s big on murder documentaries and kinda thinks she’ll be someone’s next victim. She said “it’s more likely I kill my self than I get murdered” 

“Oh” I thought she was trying to exaggerate how unlikely it is that’s she’s going to be murdered, but I asked some follow up questions. I ask her the therapist questions “how likely is it between 1 and 10 you kill yourself” and she said 5.

She told me if she fails her exams she’s going to kill herself. She’s failed her math exam 3 times before and I believe this may be the last change she has (though I’m not sure) to get it for free. She also doing another course so that she has the opportunity to work in a nursery. 

She has function autism, i would describe her as being kinda annoying to me sometimes because she repeats stuff, she gets kinda obsessive with shows. She struggles in school and she’s had some help though school. 

In the past I have expressed suicidal thoughts to family and they didn’t really care and took it like I was saying I was just sad. It really worries me, tat she expressed these thoughts, as I know what it’s like to not be sure you want to live  

What would be the appropriate thing to say ? 

I told her to promise me she doesn’t and she refused. 

We are watching YT together (i was trying to do a dopamine detox but I guess this is more important ) and she seems pretty fine like the thoughts had completely evacuated her mind, so I guess her suicide is conditional on her results and not looming constant thoughts. 

How can I make sure she doesn’t khs, or am I just overreacting being worried about the comments and not dismissing it like many others would.",13ue5lt,No-Ambition-No-Life,1685315736.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ue5lt/my_sister_said_shes_going_to_jill_herself/,,Depression

My vent about my depression,1,"It sucks how some people use suicide as a manipulative means to get others to feel sorry for them or to chain themselves unto the person, whom they want to stay. Kinda like the method that sociopaths/psychopaths use to push their agenda.

I think about that and how it, inevitably, damages people's trust for legitimate depressed people, like myself. I had, in the past, expressed my feelings of suicide but it was never with bad intent or with the means of manipulating others. I expressed suicide because I felt empty, broken and extremely lonely, at that time. It's an expression of deep hurt and hopelessness. But now, most people think it's some attention-seeking tactic or a means to an end. It breaks my heart that i can't be as vulnerable as i used to be. My heart was literally stomped on so many times. My own family became dismissive of my own feelings. My friends ghosted me when I needed them the most.

I don't have a support system but myself (I self-medicate) and I have given up on therapists because I haven't had any good services from them and I can't afford to pay for a therapist that would better match my needs. I don't have friends, partly because, I choose not to have friends.  I've had a history of toxic, fickle friendships and broken trust. I've had a history of making mistakes and losing friends that way and being blacklisted from their heart & mind. I do blame my depression for making me miss out on love because I believe in its lies, which constantly says that nobody loves me. I do blame my fears & anxiety for breaking the hearts of those who genuinely desired me because I was afraid to come out of the closet and be my authentic self.
I do blame myself for prioritizing the wrong people, the wrong things and for keeping myself imprisoned by religion & unrealistic expectations of people pleasing.
 
 Overall, my dreams of having a life-long companion has been crushed. 

I also have a very weird way of communicating (I'm not sure if I'm autistic or not but this has been on my mind lately) and this might be an issue for others.

Hard to explain to people,13,I've suffered with clinical depression since I was in my teens I'm 45 now. But I've tried antidepressants and I don't want to take them anymore. I've taken them for a long time I'm tired of what there doing to me. I just feel level.. But Its hard to put into words when your socializing or at a job when you just don't feel like talking or have anything to say because basically you don't have a fun life. That's how I feel everyday. I don't talk to my family... My mom hasn't been in my life since I was 8 years old. I work a lot but I'm supposed to be a manager but alot of  days I don't feel like telling people what to do or even talking at all.. so I get looks and people talking about me. Or they get really offended. Like no one understands I been dealing with that all my life. It's affected every aspect of it. Failed relationships. Not taking care of my body. Anger.. anxiety.. ocd... You name it I got it. But I'm stopping taking the meds because I feel like there going to lead to cancer or another disease it makes me not care about my health in done ways.. I can tell how drained I feel with out anything. Like I'm just so tired but not tired. depression eats away at everything in your life it's like a insatiable entity that just wants to destroy everything and anything you liked or loved. i have no clue how I coped this Long.  I probably did it with the help of nicotine and opiates. Namely Subutex for mat. But I quit everything all at once in 2020. But I feel completely lost Now. Everything I did enjoy I enjoyed it with a drug. Caffeine too.. All of it gone I stopped it all at once during lockdown. I made it 3 years now but honestly Id love to sit here and say I'm so happy sober. I'm really not. This is so boring. So unfun I can't even watch a movie or play a video game when I'm bored or do anything I used to do as I feel it's just not the same. I don't get the same enjoyment out of it. This honestly is bad. I don't know what to do.,13ucae1,PiccoloAdventurous25,1685310882.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ucae1/hard_to_explain_to_people/,,Depression
Feeling more depressed the closer it comes for me to move out.,1,"For the last two years I had been living with my grandmother on my moms side. It was great because I got to spend more time with her and have a better bond. I also got more space to myself and a taste of what it will be like to fully live as  an adult. My younger cousin also moved in while going through fire academy and I have loved living with her very very much.

Well my grandmother passed back in February and my mother and her siblings told my cousin and I we have until mid August to be in the house so they can put it on the market by September. I’m grateful they gave us this time left in the house and didn’t kick us out right away but as the days pass I just can’t seem to get myself to fully pack.

I have started packing and moving a few things as I will be moving in with my boyfriend of two years. But I am struggling with the fact that this is another way of fully saying goodbye to my grandmother after death. I am also struggling with leaving a room that I put work into being my own space but I know I can always do it again. 

I also have taken the responsibility of her 14 year old cat that I love deeply and I had a scare last night with him. He occasionally goes outside but I’ve never had a problem getting him back inside. Last night I had gotten home around midnight and spent ten minutes looking around the house for him and then 30 minutes calling for him outside. I was terrified that he had gone off to pass on and that I would have lost another part of my grandmother. Thankfully he finally showed up at the door and I got him inside but now I’m just in such a depressed state I feel I can barely work.",13uc8e0,Flame_Queen69,1685310741.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uc8e0/feeling_more_depressed_the_closer_it_comes_for_me/,,Depression
How do you beat depression?,6,"Im in my early 20s and struggling with depression. I feel so overwhelmed by life. I feel so frustrated with life. I feel so bored with life. Idk how to be happy. I wish I lived in a better world. A big part of my depression has been loneliness. I go to church and I've done MMA but I still get depressed. It's hard for me to make friends and talk to girls cuz I'm introverted. I haven't been doing much when I'm not work besides sitting at home watching TV and listening to music. I can't think of any hobbies that interest me. I've been seeing a counselor from the past 3 months and I just started taking antidepressants. As of right now, idk if I'll ever get better. Idk if I'll ever be happy. Idk how to be happy in this boring dark painful world. I'm trying to hang in there, I'm trying not to give up. I mean, do I have hope? Do I have any chance of getting out of this?",13uc0i9,MountainDrewMZ,1685310178.0,6,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13uc0i9/how_do_you_beat_depression/,,Depression
I don't want to lose hope but I am afraid I have to,1,"TLDR: I consider about going homeless because of my educational failures. I lost all the drive in all areas of my life. I am afraid of facing further consequences of my failures and as such I want to avoid ever seeing my own family turning against me. I don't believe in my decisiveness anymore.

As title says, I am in a shitty situation. I am soon to be 17, repeating grade 10 and not passing to the grade 11. Everyone around me says that I have odds to make it but every time I remind myself I have to study, I make up excuses or simply tell myself that I won't pass anyways, so why even bother. Education is important because money necessary for my own expenses is provided by my grandparents and I don't think they will want me to visit them if I won't pass the same grade for the second time (I have two weeks till all grades are final). 

My mom is unemployed single parent and suffers from depression. Since I got first to mental hospital, I barely get any support from her. I went to mental hospital 5 times now for suicide attempts. I am absolutely convinced I am not going to kill myself. However, I don't know if thoughts about leaving house with no possible accomodations (I would have to escape authorities as I am less than 18 years old and I am diagnosed with depression, so if they ever caught me I would be probably put in either mental hospital or in reformatory). 

I reason going homeless to be my best option because my mom would kick me out anyways and if I don't pass school I can never have job that would satisfy my ambitions. Since early age, I was admired by people older than me as intelligent but over the years I got complimented less and less. I feel like I am becoming stupid and I question if I ever can fulfill myself. As such, I think I have to meet my fate as soon as possible. 

By law, I cannot be kicked out of home until 26 if I continue education. However, as person who is soon to be in same grade for third time, I don't believe I will be able mentally to continue education. I think this is pointless and that I have no hopes for worthy future. Additionally, I don't like living in my home, it isn't a friendly place ever since I was born and as I grew older, I was avoiding it as much, as possible.

I was having plan for future but last month because of my educational failure, my perception of the world went negative. My self esteem went down and I get deeper into negative thinking. I told my school psychologist, my therapist and some of my teachers that I lost all hopes for this year but they all don't know what it truly means to me.

I think about going for next visit to therapist just to say goodbye, I feel like help towards me is waste of resources.",13tywo4,Outrageous_Car_7705,1685275690.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tywo4/i_dont_want_to_lose_hope_but_i_am_afraid_i_have_to/,,Depression

I saw my ex gf today,2,"Hello,  
  
today when i was driving home after a fun day with my friends i saw randomly my ex gf which i've been in a commited relationship for 2 years.  
  
We broke off because she said she has depressions and want to work on her self but immediately after the breakup she dated another boy from the past which she knew before our relationship.  
I never reached out to her since the breakup and never begged if she wanted to leave i said fine and got myself immediately in no contact apparently after some hard months i had no wishes anymore to get into a relationship with her.  
After a couple of months of no contact, self improvement , thai boxing classes in thailand i came back home and then she contacted me i met up with her and she said that she still has some feelings and that she regrets that she broke things off with me and she asked if i still consider being in a relationship with her.

  
It was a hard decision but the only for me to make i said to her that i can't consider to be in a relationship with her since i knew that she left off only to pursue that other boy which she declined but since i got some friends they told me about it and i got some infos which approved that.  
She said that she understands my decision and i blocked her ass in insta just to move on.  
But today after 4 Months i saw her randomly in her car in the streets driving towards me with her boyfriend , yes the same one she declined she is not dating.

  
After she saw she did a u turn to drive past me to look in my car and then she did it again.  
I just don't understand her behaviour, i guess she was trying to make me jealous to show that she has a boyfriend when i didn't wanted her back but why do you think this means?

  
She is still blocked i mean she won already she broke off with me to be with the new guy why is she trying to prove that she has a boyfriend to drive 3 times past me, i mean she is already with the new boy for almost a year, the meetup with me was 4 months ago and the breakup almost a year.

  
Maybe you have some opinion about her behaviour or in general, that would help me very much.

Just want to vent,1,"Honestly, I don’t need a pity party but I’m convinced that I just need to say what’s running through my mind. I’ve been suicidal pretty much my whole life. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve attempted. I fail at everything including trying to off myself. For the longest, I’ve been trying to save everyone cause my life is a lost cause. Been talking to this guy for like a month and he’s a great guy. However, he’s just as depressed as me. I try to be supportive and let him know I’m an outlet but he constantly gives resistance. Can’t blame him cause I’m the same way. We had an argument and it just reaffirms I suck at everything and have no idea on why I’m taking up space on this planet. Like I said I don’t need a pity party, just wanted to vent",13u53ki,Fxckyosoul,1685292599.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13u53ki/just_want_to_vent/,,Depression
I don’t want to jump off a building but I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow,1,"It’s been some time since I felt this way. A few years ago it was pretty bad but I thought that as long as I stayed distracted it would’ve been fine. And it was. I was still okay when I was distracted with things, and when I could do things that I enjoyed. I kept my mind busy so that I’m not consumed by my room of thoughts, and so that I’m not truly alone in my mind. 

Things were quite alright for the past couple of years. There were a few ups and downs but nothing too crazy. It was enough to make me feel like maybe I was ok again. 

But these days, things don’t feel like they’re looking up. I feel like nothing truly makes me happy. I don’t enjoy what I enjoy anymore. Things that I used to love doing don’t seem to be fun anymore. It seems to be a chore. It’s starting to become a thing that I don’t feel like going back to. My hobbies are not giving me the same joy and satisfaction it used to, and this makes me scared. Because nothing else would work then.

I feel like I’m rotting. All I do is sleep and work and sleep and work. I know people say that they try to slide in some personal time before or after work but honestly, I’m so drained after work that I just want to head home so that I have enough rest for tomorrow’s work. There’s no way I would wake up early to do things because I really need the sleep. These repetitive days are taking a toll on me. I’m not looking forward to anything and nothing excites me. 

I have my friends and loved ones but none I truly connect with. It’s not that we’ve never opened up, It’s just that everyone’s in different phases of life that it seems difficult to understand each other or find time to actually spend quality time together. Even when we do have time, the things we enjoy doing are no longer the same.  

At least in the past I still enjoyed my hobbies or just looking through YouTube/TikTok. Now it just feels like I’m rotting more inside. Whatever I do, it feels like I’m sinking in a fog. The small inconveniences in life accumulates and irritates me and I just feel down. 

I don’t feel like doing anything and I don’t want to do anything. Meeting new people is a drag because the process of opening up feels so dreadful and troublesome. Even maintaining current friendships tire me presently. I’m withdrawing from social situations and I know that this is only going to make things worse since I’ll be spending more time by myself. However, I really don’t feel like putting myself out there and socialize. It’s tiring. 

I wish the world would end tomorrow or at least I would disappear in my sleep. I want to be forgotten when I disappear but at the same time I don’t. Ideally I just want to be remembered fondly but not for my absence to bring pain. I feel responsible for a lot of things and this recent realization made me understand a little more of why I feel exhausted. 

The mould that would never go away in my house no matter how much I cleaned and paid for services for, the water leakage in my wall that can’t be fixed, the insurance I have to pay, the money I have to save, the people I have to care for, the future partner I will meet, the future children I have to be responsible for, the future old-and-sick me I have to be prepared for, the future passing of loved ones I have to be ready for… All these scares me and exhausts me.

I don’t want to think, I don’t want to feel. Even if I know that love is the greatest emotion and the best feeling I could ever have, if there’s a possibility of feeling pain of the same intensity then I would rather not feel at all. 

I’m scared of pain, so I can’t exactly kill myself. Not that I want to. I think I still have a little bit of I-want-to-live in me but, if the world ended tomorrow or if I died in my sleep, I wouldn’t mind. I might even feel relieved. My only worry would be the pain I will cause to people around me.

Tldr is I’m a coward weighed with accumulated mini problems that I can no longer handle, and no longer have the motivation to deal with. Probably the biggest problem would be me.",13u5afx,nicolelaa,1685293061.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13u5afx/i_dont_want_to_jump_off_a_building_but_i_wouldnt/,,Depression

I just need to get this out...,2,"I have struggled with depression for a long time but after starting medication a year and a half ago (+4 years of therapy and some inpatient treatment), I thought it was under control. I can still see that objectively I have a lovely life - a great place to live with a garden, a decent job and promotion offers, as well as a lot of close and deep friendships.
However, over the past few months / nearly a year the bad habits crept back in - drinking too much, smoking, eating crap and putting on weight. I had all of these things so under control for years (quit drinking, quit smoking, got much healthier). 
I'm angry at myself. I let my guard down. 

In the recent weeks I have had suicidal and intrusive thoughts more and more often. Tonight is worse though somehow. 
I went to see Guardians 3 with friends in the cinema and found myself thinking about wanting to kill myself mid film (not because the film was terrible, it's alright). 
I'm angry at everything. Everything feels pointless and wrong and stupid. 

I don't know why it's back. Nothing bad has happened or anything and I wish I had a reason. For now though, the thought of this continuing makes me exhausted. I'm tired and even the thought of living a good life where I'm happy again feels empty.

My dad chose my abusive mom over me and now our relationship is stunted.

My boyfriend gets angry at me for having anxiety and so does everyone else. Can’t say I predicted this to happen when we first met but I sort of swallowed my anxiety in the beginning and I guess he’s just finally getting the real me now and doesn’t like me or something.

The lowest I've ever been TW - suicide mention,1,"Hi, I hit rock bottom. I'm lowest I've ever been, I am overwhelmed by school, people everything. I have so much I need to do, so many promises, so many deeds. I'm really struggling, the most I've ever did in my entire life. I have strong diagnosed but not treated ADHD, and I don't wanna use it as an excuse, but it is the reason I'm writing this. For those who have ADHD, I think you know what I'm talking about, for those who don't I'll explain.

I've  always had ADHD, and I've been mocked and bullied for being different, so I started to mask it, and over time, I started to lose myself, until eventually my mask became myself, and my true self were buried deep within. Yes it's unnatural, yes it hurts, when you realize that you aren't being yourself, and that you forgot how to even be yourself.

The thing I struggle most with is something called ADHD paralysis. Sure for most people, doesn't matter if they know me or not (like my mother, but I'll talk about her later), it can look like I'm just being lazy, but for me, I'm screaming at myself in my brain to do something, but I just can't, it's just impossible for me, to get up and do something. And then other thing arrive, and I didn't even started previous tasks, so I get overwhelmed by it, get locked in my little brain unable to do anything, and the snowball just keeps rolling, getting bigger and bigger.

So you would say ""Find help. Reach out to some psychologist"". Well, that's the problem. I just recently turned 18 and where I live, you can go to psychologist/psychiatrist, but only with your parent consent, and the doctor is allowed to say all we talked about, because I have no right to decide what is and what isn't good for me (which btw I think is fucked up, like c'mon I was 17 but my parents still have the last word). And when we talked about it, my father was like ""Ok, ok, we can talk about it"". But my mother, very conservative women in her 50's, was like ""You're not trying hard enough. You are just hurting yourself"" and when I started crying she just told me that I just need to be happy, and that being sad wrong. Like good work mom, you helped a lot. (She also sent me some articles about famous people with ADHD, claiming that those people did it without meds, and like the second thing that those people talked about, was how getting meds changed their life)

**TW - suicide mention**

>!This is the lowest I've ever been, even lower than when I tried to off myself, twice or thrice, I'm not sure. It didn't work out, as you can prolly tell, and I have no intention of trying again rn. The big difference is that than I was able to feel emotions, right now, I'm just numb, the living definition of ""It is what it is"". This is also one of the reasons why I didn't go to anyone, my parents don't know about this, and even if I hate my mother more than I love her, I still don't wanna hurt her, and for her to see my struggles. Yes I'll move out as soon as possible, and I'll start living on my own with my friend. But I still don't want to hurt her... Love is strange thing, isn't it.!<

One of the problems I'm also struggling with, are Body Dysmorphia and Eating Disorders. Because my coping mechanism is eating, so I'm kind of chubby, and little overweight, and I don't feel good in my own skin. But I also don't have the money, time and patience to go to gym or anything, so once in a while, I'll just reduce my eating to something close to nothing, sometimes even going for week or so without any food.

***Some word to end this***

I'm graduating Highschool next year, but ironically add pre-graduate year is the hardest in Czech Republic. Next year, I'll move out to city where my school is with one of my best friends, and one of the few who actually knows who am I really, without mask . He is year older, so he is going to university, but we are very close. He said that he'll get me contact for his psychiatrist, so I can have someone who'll help me, and we're planning on slowly changing my habits, to allow me to become myself again, starting with the little things like everyday running, or late night deeptalks on the roof.

Edit: The only situation I could describe my current mental condition is by what happened hour ago. I found out that I lost 150 day streak in Duolingo and I broke down and cried for solid 15 minutes, because this little stupid thing is so important to me (guess what, my mother forced me to start doing Duolingo, even tho I don't need it that much), that I felt like biggest disappointment, and it broke me down.

*For those who red this to the end, thank you for reading this, because writing is one of my coping mechanism. I don't need your pity, or you telling me that everything be alright, because I know it will. But if you have the time, you can leave nice comment with words of encouragement, not only for me, but for everyone reading it. Or your leave your own little story because I, like all of us, sometimes forget that I'm not the only one struggling, that we're not alone :)*",13u9s3o,HoKkSs,1685304446.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13u9s3o/the_lowest_ive_ever_been_tw_suicide_mention/,,Depression

"So overwhelmed with life, I can't do it",3,"I'm extremely depressed. I'm a senior in college and I'm in two 3-week courses which are very intensive. I have to do an internship before I graduate and those are very stressful (I've done one already). I'd have to balance it with a full schedule, too. I feel drained even showering...but of course I can't let that be known to my professors or people I internship for. I have to pretend I am just the happiest and most motivated person on earth.

In depth discussion on depression,1,"Lets not waste time and head straight to the discussion. I think many people feel depressed when their minds are disheveled and unorganized. You might be feeling depressed now or you might be feeling depressed all the time who knows, but did you ever ask yourself the reason behind whats causing it? There are different forms of depressions. For example, the depression that you feel when you're subconsciously trying to avoid your problems and the depression when someone close to you dies are completely different. In fact, there are no same depression. Some people are depressed due to lack of sunlight and some are depressed thinking about the future. Depressions are limitless. Which indicates that the cures are also different.   
But theres one ultimate cure. It is also the hardest one and its very simple. Which is just to be brave and tackle your depression head on. I think the god or whoever made depression in the first place made it so that it can only be cured by tacking it head on. However, there are also depressions that can't be solved easily, for example, living in poverty. It is well known that not having food on the table is the harshest form of depression and theres not much you can do. But is there really no way to tackle it head on? There is, if you think hard enough you can find it.   
If this ultimate cure exists then you may ask, ""then why are there so still many depressed people?"". To answer that, depression is a very crippling disease. It directly affects your mind and prevents you from tacking it head on. Which is why you need others to guide at the right moments, but sadly not everyone has the right person to guide them. This led to therapists. Lets be honest, people really don't want to visit therapist. Going to the therapists screams ""I have severe mental issues"" which is the stereotypes. So people usually avoids.   
You'll see that many underdeveloped countries are less depressed. The answer lies in family: Joint and nuclear family. In Joint families, the elderly are your therapist. They are also your motivators and your strength. In this type of family what happens is that everyone gets to live together and share each others moment of joy and sadness. While your privacy do get decreased living in such a large family, being less depressed is more important. There is also the depression from being too stagnant. So don't hold yourself from doing something fun. In the past, people were less depressed due to the fact that they had no internet. Internet where we can get short term fun very easily corrupts our subconscious mind, and sadly theres nothing we can do about this. Past people had to work really hard for some fun and they went out to sun a lot. Racisms and hate all did exist but it didn't spread as fast and as much due to the same reason, the internet.   
Another important thing that our ancestors had in the past was their fearlessness towards death. No matter which depression I think about, it leads to the same point which is the people's fear of death. We all think of ourselves as great and mighty when in fact we're nothing but insignificant lifeforms in the supreme river of time. Once you overcome the fear of death a new road will be opened to you and you will view the world in different light. However, overcoming the fear of death is not easy. Its a long spiritual journey and at the end of the path everyone will create their own road and live till the end. Remember, In this world everyone is a main character, but everyone is also a side character.

Could this be it?,0,"First off very sorry for misspelling or not making sense, today is probably the start of what is the end, so please bare with me.

Hi, I'm 48(M) for all my life I have been battling to be accepted, to see if I had a family, my parents were very abusive to me, I got hit with brooms, pulled hair, ears, with closed fists on the stomach, back and head.

My mother never said one word to stop the abuse and she her self was part of it at times, my brother would cry about things that we did and then I would get the brunt of it, if my brother got bad grades guess who got the bad end of stick.

Last night it came to a final end, to start my father died 16 years ago, and at his final days me and him had a conversation and he was very sorry for how he treated me, at that point at was at peace, but last night my brother and my mother just went off on me, reason being was that me and my son were walking in Prescott, Az and the whole family went for ""family time, at the point that when were returning to Phoenix, me and my son were walking to the car, my mother got very upset because I wasn't walking at the same pace as her and my sister in law and both of them think that I did it on purpose because I didn't want to be part of the ""group"". This was complete BS, some point of reference I live in Plano, Tx, my sons live in Phoenix, so we are taking a trip to New Zealand tomorrow and I'm in Phoenix to spend time with them and my supposed family. Returning to the car thing, as I got to the car, my thinking is let me hurry up an go get them, well, as I'm turning the car on, I get a call from my sister in law, telling me to go get them, which is what I was doing exactly, I went I pick them up a couple of blocks down, the car was parked in a very steeped hill, I go pick them up, they didn't seem upset or anything, so I picked them up and I dropped my sister in law where my brother's truck was parked.

As we were driving back to Phoenix, the first thing I get from my mother is this rant as to why I didn't wait for them, I told her that this always happens I for some reason or other I'm at fault for doing something that wasn't intentional, she got super upset, all the drive back to Phoenix was quiet, but I felt hopeless like I'm just done, I Just can't anymore.

We come home, the first thing my son says, ""Please take me home, I don't want to spend the night here"", I understood why, so I took my son home, as I was returning to my brother's house, I get a text message that ""we need to talk"", so I was just like had no emotions I felt nothing like I could care less.

I come home and both my brother and mother just go off on my, calling me a liar when they don't understand when I'm talking to them, bringing things from the past, that had no substance whatsoever, in all of this I was surprised that I didn't feel anger, sadness, I was just chill defending myself of them calling me a liar, that it's all in my head that nothing that I say to them is true, my brother has never ever cared one bit about my depression in fact, I blame him for part of it, my mother also has a part in this, and the way that they were going after me felt like more of trying to excuse themselves for not understanding me, than trying to actually understand my disease and how to help and cope with it.

This visit to Phoenix was to actually look for a house to be close to my children but in all, after this I just can't the pain is too much, just to think that I live in the same city as them and to think of the painful things they told me, I don't know if I can, I have a very stable life in Plano, Tx, but the fact that I can't move closer to my boys hurts like hell, but I think that also I have to look out for my mental health, but last night has brought me thoughts of suicide and thoughts of worthlessness and I can't cry and can't be sad, it's just feels different than other times, I just wanted to rant to see if I can but seems like this is on another level.",13u68pp,NotWhatIHopeFor,1685295367.0,2,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13u68pp/could_this_be_it/,,Depression

Am I depressed?,2,"I’m 19M, who lives in what I think of as a “happy” household.

Anyway, recently my girlfriend of 4 years who I spent all of high school with and some time before that, broke up with me because I had a very tough time expressing how I was feeling or what was on my mind etc, etc… (there’s obviously more to it, I’m just summing it up). I been absolutely devastated and just broken all together. I’ve been slowly starting to talk to people about how I’ve been feeling and it got me wondering if I’m showing moderate signs of depression.

But putting the break up aside, this is how I’ve been feeling before:

So I’d say maybe 2-4 months before we broke up, I had very little to no appetite for no reason. I typically get all my meals in and sometimes more. But since then, I’ve just had no appetite at all. I’m basically eating because I know I have to, and sometimes I get sick because of that.

Sometimes I feel nothing. No emotion, not happy, nor sad. Just nothing. I’m not sure how else I could explain it other than that.

I’ve been very irritated, very snappy at people. Even when they’re are just trying to say something as simple as “hi”.

Furthering on that point, I just don’t feel like talking to anyone in general. It’s almost as if I don’t have the energy to talk to any other human. I’ve only really had the energy to work, because I have to then go home.

Sometimes my friends have to do a lot of convincing to make me do things that’s I’ve always loved doing. I just don’t feel like doing stuff as much.

No suicidal thoughts or anything like that.

I just know the breakup has added a lot of weight on me and just made me really think about how I’ve been feeling mentally in the past. Also, a concern to me is that my parents might over worry if they hear the word “depression” come out of my mouth. And I really just don’t know if I’m overthinking about myself and I’m fine. I’m just pretty lost to what to think in general right now.",13u5sat,Bruins15_,1685294232.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13u5sat/am_i_depressed/,,Depression
My husband makes me feel bad for my depression as if I am doing it on purpose and enjoy it.,4,"He takes it completely personal and says that telling him how sad I feel over and over again is annoying and he's ""not a mental health professional. He can't help me."" It just reaffirms all of my sadness and that inner voice telling me Noone cares and Noone will miss me. I don't want to feel this way I love laughing and being happy.  Whenever i feel that way i always express how i wish i could feel like that forever. But then as soon as my fucked up mind comes back to normal I'm back to feeling worthless and sad and hopeless about literally everything. 

Intrusive thoughts harm me more than anything. I understand that my experiences in childhood have shaped this maladapted behavior yet I cannot seem to ever heal the trauma. I've gone to therapy time and time again I'm currently on max doses of two different antidepressants etc. I still feel lonely and lost day in and day out. I sleep all of the time and when I can't sleep I lay in bed hoping I'll be able to fall asleep again. Why am I wrong? Is there something I should be doing different? Should I keep it all to myself and just hope for the best?  I'm terrified of dying yet terrified of living. I can't figure out a way to get those i love to understand that to me dying seems like the better option solely because it means the pain will be gone. They take my feelings as completely selfish. I feel the same towards their take. I should live a miserable life with no successful treatment just to spare them the grief and hardship. It really breaks my soul.

Screaming into the void.,2,"I know posting here is like screaming into a void and hoping for a helpful response. But sometimes a little screaming can help. I know it is every depressed individual's first response is to consider ending it all when life gets really really bad. As much as it sounds like a cliché, I feel the same. 

I lost my best friend over a stupid mistake. I had to let go of a lover who I saw a future with. I might lose my job. And I have way too many responsibilities to take individual decisions. One wrong step from my end will result in a disaster for my family. I have to keep going through normal life while it feels like my insides are slowly dying and causing me pain.

I am so tired of swimming against the tide and having to try so much for even the most basic things. I don't feel like going on anymore. I know people have it worse. I know people have it better. And I know that comparison will only make me feel worse. But all around me I see people getting what they want. Finding people who love them. Finding things and situations that make them happy. While I have been fighting with this invisible enemy since I was a child. At what point can I call life unfair without feeling guilty? At what point can I give up?

Antidepressants and personality changes,27,"Hi everyone! (31F here)
I was diagnosed with depression on 2016 and started with antidepressants that same year. I was on meds for 7 years (not always the same meds, but antidepressants and antipsychotics) and finally decided to leave all of them 2 months ago. 
I felt my personality had changed too much, I turned into a pleasing person, always trying to please everyone and make them happy around me; my friends and also my family, and even people I didn’t know. So in the end I felt like I had no personality at all, I became insecure about myself and my self esteem was incredibly low. 
Now I’ve been 2 months clean and I’m starting to feel like me again, I even think I was able to realize all of this and connect the dots…

Has anyone had this experience too or been in this situation? I would very much like to read your story and know I’m not the only one!

Is this depression or something else?,2,"I’ve never felt this way before and it’s really starting to freak me out. I’m typically someone who’s anxious, so apathy is completely new to me. It’s like I’m living in a fog. I can’t even think clearly enough to bust myself out of this. I can’t muster up the energy to do anything. I just lay around most days trying to decide on anything to do with myself. I’m restless but exhausted. I make all these plans, but I can never seem to follow through. 

Night comes, and I’m relieved because at least I have an excuse to lay around lol. I just can’t sleep tho. I’m up until 2AM endlessly scrolling YouTube shorts. It’s the only thing I have the energy for. Tv shows suddenly take up too much energy. Yet I can’t sit still enough to watch one. My grandpa and I used to watch an episode of Parks and Rec every night, but lately I’ve been making up excuses to get out of it. I don’t even enjoy being on my phone like I used to anymore. It just seems like the only thing to do. 

I don’t enjoy any of the things that used to bring me joy. The big one is gaming. I’ve gone through a lot of rough periods in my life, but I’ve never completely lost interest in gaming. In fact, gaming is what’s gotten me through a lot of the hard times. It just seems pointless to me now. A waste of time. I keep trying to start new games, but it just bores me now. 

I used to wake up and make myself a healthy breakfast, now it just hits 3pm before I realize I haven’t eaten anything yet and I force myself to eat some crackers. The only thing I have energy to eat is junk food. 

I used to love doing things with my dog, now I’ve shirked all of my parenting responsibilities over to my mom. Who doesn’t seem to mind btw, but still. 

All of this came on really suddenly with no apparent cause. I haven’t been able to break myself out of it for a few months now. I’m seeing a new therapist as of last week. What are some action steps I can take right now? A game plan if you will. Is this depression? Please help me.

Turning 30 this summer and I don’t think I want to make it all the way there.. Depression has been my constant companion my whole life. I don’t think I really know any other way of being. For the last 2 1/2 years I’ve been in a rocky relationship and last night I put things to an end after one too many harsh words were spoken to me. Today I am regretting that. I would rather take emotional abuse than be alone. Cripplingly alone. No one to turn to in my darkest time right now. No true, real friends. Not a single one. Its like I don’t know how to build a bond with anyone. I have my mom… who I live with because my life sucks… but she doesn’t want to hear the same shit I’ve been saying for two years. I have a minimum wage job because I can’t stand the shitty, mind-numbing office grind anymore… and because I lost both office jobs during Covid…I have no plans. No aspirations. Nothing I “want” to do with my life. Don’t even know what to do with my pathetic life.

I'm s failure in life,0,"My life the last year had been hell.  I've been fighting mental health issues most of my life but it's the worse it's ever been.  I've tried to take my life 3 times all unsuccessful. I'm such a failure I can't even kill myself. 
It started in August.  My wife left me, Because of my mental health she was the main money maker n in on disability.  I slept in my car for a week until I found a room to rent since I don't get enough for my own place and it all goes down hill.  My kids stop talking to me n block me on every thing n I have no idea why.  I have physical disabilities that make it hard to work on top of the mental but I'm trying. I'm in physical pain always humid n wet days make it so much worse. I eat seldom because most of the money I get goes to rent. I have no family, no friends nothing.  I'm beyond poor, lost my car most of the possessions no future outlooks except my disabilities getting worse and have been told eventually I'll lose the use of my legs and my hands are starting. 
I grew up poor and  struggled to get out of it. I finally did than all these ailments happened but it's ok because I have a loving spouse who I supported for decades. Now after she is set up n great job she leaves me.  I have never felt such betrayal n hopelessness.  I'm right back to where I was as a teen poor n no future.  I failed as a husband, a father my career and  I've lost everything.  I'm even a failure at suicide. I just wish I could go to sleep n not wake up..

School has broke me,2,"I'm 14 and I wouldn't be surprised if I was diagnosed with depression. Constantly can't get the problem out my head, feeling tired, don't feel any worth in anything anymore, used to be so excited with sunny weather now I don't care at all and I dread school and I am in desperate need for someone to notice I am not okay. 

I had a best friend, we had arguments and all but we were best friends. One day, we stop speaking to each other. I was heartbroken, why was he ignoring me. But I got over it. I still felt abandoned though. Then another best friend, one I had for so so long, one that I would laugh and talk with so often starts ignoring me. I am so desperate to chase after them, I had already lost one and I would suffer if I lost another. They stop speaking to me and I find out it's because she likes someone and other people keep saying me and her like each other. I know she don't like me and I know who she likes. So she has to ignore me so people move on from saying we like each other. And she thinks the person she likes she won't have any chance with him if other people thinks she likes me instead. But people have always shipped us and our friendship never broke? It's just so selfish she is doing this for the person she likes who is racist, rude and has done nothing for her. Then she starts talking to me again and I get happy. I tell her I'll message her and we can talk. I message and get no response at all. And the ignoring continues. HOW MUCH MORE DOES SHE WANT TO BREAK ME. Why set me up so bad. I always gave her advice on what to do with the person she liked and I did so so much for her. Now she ignores me. Every school day. It's horrible. I see her face and I'm instantly reminded that I have lost another person in my life and I have been abandoned again. 

I helped her with everything. I feel so betrayed. And I just hate everything. I have never ever suffered this much before. I wake up, get one minute of peace before finally realising I have lost another person. 

Then one of her friends who I talk to stops sitting next to me In lessons. if it's a lesson where she sits next to me, she goes up to the teacher and asks to move next to her friend which is the one that ignores me now. 

I feel like I have lost everything. I told my mom and cried a lot with her. She supported me but it looks like she has just thought I have gotten over it. I am so so desperate for someone to just notice I am NOT OKAY. When I was hugging my mom and telling her everything she said to be a man. She didn't say it in a annoyed way or a way where she found me being overactive but I just knew that my mom would not help that much. 

I just can't get my feelings out to my mom again. I just can't speak out again. 

I feel I have lost everything. I want and need help. I feel so lost. I feel so abandoned. I wouldn't care if I died or if I was hospitalised. My school is a prison. My kindness is always overlooked by the disgusting and fake people there. And it's been heavily overlooked by people I never thought I would lose. My life is meaningless now and I want to die. If I died then all this suffering would end. All of it. I would be freed from this world of pain. When I sleep my mind is put to rest but I have to wait the whole day for that. If I die I would be free. I really would be free. I hope I die soon.

Can't escape my own escapism,0,"Please glean some meaning off of my story.


As it stands, I have everything that I chose to attain and yet nothing that I need.

Some background info, I'm an 18 year old guy living an otherwise fine life with a loving family, and 1 year of college already under my belt. I don't hate my life, and I don't wish for another. I'm human.

I wish I would start living.

As the title says, I've gone on too long living the same way I have for years. Always running away, always turning a cheek, always finding distractions and drowning in harmful coping mechanisms. 

Looking back I never acted or reacted in acceptable ways, which developed into the coping mechanisms such as video games, eating unhealthy, and worst of all porn that helped distract me from a divorce. A divorce that led to depression. I wouldn't take care of myself properly, never cared about appearance, and didn't eat right. It caused me to gain an unacceptable amount of weight

All those harmful coping mechanisms turned me into a weak man. I was 250 pounds at 15 years old. That sickens me. Even now im 228 at best, and for a 5""10 guy that's fat. To me it's fat. Fatness isn't the only thing, I'm weak too. I can only bench 90 for one rep and can only deadlift 120 because that's all the weight I have to lift, I'm too much of a pussy to even go to the gym. I even paid for a subscription for the gym at my college through tuition, and never went. 

Not just physically, but emotionally as well. I can't look people in the eye and say anything without feeling disingenuous and hollow. I want to just be able to love and feel like I'm conveying emotion again. I have a loving family but i can't feel like I do. 

That's what I meant by otherwise fine life. My life IS fine, I have people that support me and encourage me, and it's my own psyche that hinders me from feeling that love. Years of numbing the pain have turned me into a weak, disingenuous, hollow existence and I can’t escape my own coping mechanisms. I'm human.

-

First year of college ended, and I've got nothing to do with my life. I got a job landscaping to pass the time, but I quit after the first shift because of a whole load of factors, some of which I'm not proud of. I'm attempting at a position with the same company my dad works for, but it's been three weeks since I've gotten the ok to start working (waiting for approval for the position, most likely gonna get it in the next fiscal year.) 

In those three weeks I've had nothing to do with my life, aside from occasionally seeing family. 

It's made me realize how empty I am. 

All I do is numb myself with those coping mechanisms. There's nothing else to me, I don't help people, I don't work on myself as much as I should, and I don't feel like I'm doing anything valuable. Just wasting away. Day after day, night after night. 

I am somehow getting better, i've dropped some weight and gained a lot of mechanical ability that I was incapable of before, such as being able to perform a proper push up, going on actual runs where I dont stop every three minutes, and a lot more.

 I'm moving in the right direction, just slowly, and that's the problem. I'm taking too long to get better. My progress is too slow, and I'm starting to ease back into physical comforts.

Never having felt loved in my life despite the affections I've received from family play a huge part in the emotional weakness I have.

I feel neglected, even though I wasn't.
I feel disingenuous, even though I'm not. 
I feel hollow. 

I can't even feel proud of myself for anything. I've been teaching myself guitar for the past 8 years and can confidently say I'm good at it, I should be proud of that. I'm not. It's like I can't be. 

Fuck I mean I made it through two semesters of college. That's a hell of an achievement. Still feel nothing.

Just empty. It's like a constant melancholy. I don't know how to fill it, because the distractions and coping mechanisms are like putting a band aid on a gunshot wound. 

It's hard for me to love, because I'm empty and kind of an asshole so I can't fill it with love.

I'm weak, so I can't fill it with something like the gym though I want to. 

And I can't fill it with anger or hatred or anything like that, that goes against everything I stand for.

Which leaves me empty. 

I can't continue like this. I'm breaking. I didn't even know what a mental breakdown was until a friend described one to me, because I had them all the time to the point where I thought that was normal. But now I can't feel at all. I don't have breakdowns anymore, it's just like my heart is a void that dissipates any emotion without letting me feel it. 

-

I have everything I chose to attain. Everything I wanted to do I did, every single harmful habit. I chose to be what I am today. It's what I wanted. That's the mortifying part. I'm exactly what I made myself become. 

I need help. I need to be better and I know it painfully well. But I'm not better. I'm human.

I was never okay with what I was turning into. Yet I still made myself into this. 
 
I'll never forgive myself for being myself, because I hate what I made myself and want myself to be something other than myself. It's actually kind of an ironic and funny thing to think about.  

I know I need to keep moving forward. I have my good days of extreme positivity and motivation that help propel me forward just like everyone else. I'm human too.

I just don't feel human. Like I've wasted a great gift. Nothing in this world can change my past, but fuck does it not help to know I could have been better. 

I could have been everything I actually genuinely wanted to be. 

Could have been a good friend.

Could have been a good son.

Could have been a good lover. Fucked that up royally.

I'm a slave to myself. Slave to bad habits and harmful attitudes. I can't escape what I made myself, and tearing myself down to build myself up again is doing its job. I've been torn down. And now im stuck. 

I feel like I'm going insane, which is a little liberating. And terrifying. 

I'm human. You're human too. I could have been you and you could have been me. 

-

If you read this far, I don't know what to say or how to end this massive rant about my pitiful life. 

If you resonate with what I've wrote, I'm so fucking sorry. I want to help. 

I'd love to hear about similar issues and offer the best advice I can. It would help make me feel like I'm doing something valuable. You can even dm me if you don't want many eyes to see it. I just want to help anyone feeling the same as me. 

All in all though, maybe take my woes as a lesson and forge on. That's what I'd be happy with. Godspeed, and don't turn out like me. Please.

I don’t know what to do anymore,0,"I want to give up, so badly. I spend every day miserable and I don’t have any interest in doing anything. I want to have interest, I try to put in the effort but I just can’t get my self to give a fuck.

Feeling Lost,0,"I’ve been struggling with depression and OCD off and on for my whole life. I’ve been on several medications (sertraline, Trintellix, prozac to name a few) and lately I’ve come to a point where none of them seem to work anymore. My doctor wants to do gene screening to try and find something that might metabolize better, but he also thinks my depression might be medication resistant.

That means that my two most prominent options according to my doctor are Ketamine therapy and ECT. I’m afraid of both options tbh, because ketamine is addictive and ECT literally zaps your brain and gives you a seizure and people have also reported memory loss, but my depression isn’t getting better even with meds and therapy. I’m still spending most of my time in bed, I’m still having passive suicidal thoughts, I still don’t care about anything. 

I guess my question is has anyone else gone through either of these treatments? What was it like and how are you now?",13tkta7,WaitWhat-86,1685228477.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tkta7/feeling_lost/,,Depression
My first post ever,2,"Hello guys,

It's my first time posting ever. I'm not sure how to express myself. I feel very empty. And lonely. Thing is I have good friends, I go out often, I workout 5-6 times a week and during my workout I feel very peaceful and happy, I see great results. Gym might be my only source of happyness but it only last for a few hours. Currently I'm in my second year of uni, I really enjoy my subject, my grades are good. But I struggle to get a job- I submitted to like 30 places but it seems no one wants me. I understand that a lot of people are in similiar situatuions, but it doesn't help. So everything I put hard work into turns out like sh\*t- I study my ass off, I put time into socialising with friends and my girl, I work on myself, I have hobbies. But at the end of the day I feel empty ,with no place and no one to talk about my situation, since I'm not really close with my family (I do love them though) and I don't want to talk to my friends about it.

I'm not sure why I posted or if you understood what I said, maybe writing it alone will help lol. Anyways, I hope you guys have a great week!",13txfrr,Anxious_Weight_4014,1685270933.0,8,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13txfrr/my_first_post_ever/,,Depression

I wish I didn't feel so trapped & had a community of friends I could talk to. (Rant),0,"So the loneliness & the trapped feeling started maybe 2 years ago. But when I was 16, I decided that when I didn't have any pets anymore, I was gonna kill myself. At the time, I had 2 cats & 1 dog. I was living with my mum, and I thought if I killed myself at 16, out of grief, my mum wouldn't care about the animals anymore and would decline in her health. I thought it would lead to a low quality  of life for the cats & dog.

Now we have 2 dogs & 1 cat (1 of the cats from 1st paragraph). I've calculated that I have at least til 2032 to 2035, then kill myself if I haven't managed to improve my life. I'm currently 23 Yrs old as of writing this post.

I can't talk to any of my ""friends"" about it because I already feel like a burden to them. I spoke to 3 friends on the week of my birthday. I broached the subject of messaging me more. The response I got were to the affect of (1)""well we have lives and we're really busy"", (2) ""that's not my style, I like to message now & then, I prefer to meet up & talk"" & (3)""yeah, I struggle to keep up with messages"".

My ""friends"" have busy lives with other friends, BUT I HAVE NO ONE!! 1 doesn't understand I'm asking because I'm fucking lonely & on the verge of killing myself, 2's response seems to me like a boundary & I'm obviously going to respect it. 3 just has other friends that message them a fair amount which is what I want! I want to be inconvenience with messages from a couple different people! I want friends that actively want to message me & message me first or message me first more than the ""friends"" I have now!
I know these people have their own lives & other friends (which I got the impression 1 didn't think i had thought of). Prior to that week I barely messaged them because I thought I was interrupting them doing something with their friends or being a burden. Since that week I stopped messaging because I felt so unimportant to these people that I thought if I matter at all to them & they wanted to talk to me they would message me. I'd grown sick & tired of messaging first. 

A month after this 1 messaged me & say something about it being a long time. I was a bit short with them but still ""normal"".
The conversation was good & ended well. I've not messaged them since & I won't. 
I know me instigating message is important for creating & continuing bonds between me & other people but I'm depressed, I want to die and I have no life I'm not busy or occupied.

I am trying to do something with myself but I have no motivation for anything. I barely have the motivation to walk my dogs, I try to do it in the cool of the early morning.

I just need to be allowed to regain my motivation.


I have my 2 dogs & 1 cat standing between me & death because I have not now or have ever have emotional or mental support from anyone in my life.

I got snapped at and told to ""sort yourself out"" and ""to get help if I can't motivate yourself"" and they way I was ""living"" was ""not a healthy way to be for you"" because I fell asleep in the afternoon and defended myself by saying I was tired (because I was). They said they try to help and they had no extra energy. But they don't help, they never help. They make every fucking worse!!
I'm currently stuck living with the person I quoted. They really upset me when they sent their messages (which I've been quoting). I instantly felt like replying ""fucking fine then I'll kill myself this evening then I won't be a burden anymore!"" but I didn't. I cry massively twice alone and went about my day.

This person has been under their own very stressful situation recently & I've been trying to keep out their way & helping with their situation minorly. But that's still no excuse for causing me emotional harm, all I'm asking of them is patience I'm not asking them to help me with anything. 
I'd like this person to apologise for causing the emotional  harm that they have, but even if I manage to get them to acknowledge it, their apology won't be a true apology. So it's not worth confronting them about it.
I have applied for talk therapy & have an appointment late next month. 
Hopefully I can do this therapy thing till I'm less suicidal or not suicidal.

But as it is I have 3 wonderful animals  who I love so very much, keeping me alive.

Thought about suicide 4 different times while at a concert today,3,"I’m such a terrible person. My friend is visiting me from across the state for the weekend and we went to see a concert. I’ve been going through a bad episode all week and avoiding/ignoring communications with my friends from school. They’ve been texting me asking if I’m okay and I’ve just been ignroing and trying to act normal for my friend who’s visiting. We planned this weekend months in advance and I realized I can’t rot in my bedroom all weekend if she’s here. I didn’t post anything about the concert tonight because I’m sure it would definitely make my other friends go “wtf? Why have they been ignoring me while meanwhile they are having fun?” I’m a terrible friend to everyone and a liar at that. I have not been enjoying myself at all. I tried to enjoy myself at the concert and thought to myself “You know I could jsut stop being depressed rn and be normal and apologize to everyone for being a shit friend” . But no. I choose to be a piece of shit and ruin my relationships like this. This is exactly where my actions have lead me to. This is the results of my active efforts

"I'm the wrong kind of Autistic for a happy, meaningful life",1,"I'm not employable. I can't study. I can't socialize because I'm mentally disabled.

I'm just so fucking tired of it all. I'm tired of waking up. There's no help or hope for Autistic adults like me. There's no pathway to make my life meaningful. We rot on the edge of society and die by suicide. I've lost count of my attempts.

The NHS won't help me. They don't do therapy for systemic neglect/oppression/poverty. And they can't work with mentally disabled people like me. They refused me.

I knew she is dealing with depression and tried to commit suicide a year ago, and I know all the reasons for it, such as bullying abusive ex and more...

She told me yesterday that she thought about committing suicide, but she decided not to do it and doesn't have the power to do it. It honestly scares me, and I honestly cried when she told me that, because she told me things got better and that I'm helping her so much but as you know depression is sometimes random with episodes.

For my best friend he's on the same boat, depressed and tells me all the time that he's thinking about it but won't really ever do it.

Now the problem here is since I'm a half healthy person (Mild Depression that I know how to control) and very good at helping people vent and figure out problems, that they literally have me as their source of happiness. They both don't want to go to therapy, and I don't know how to deal with this and afraid they'll drown me to severe depression with them.

advice for returning to college after a mental health break?,0,"I had to file for a leave of absence last schoolyear because my depression, anxiety and OCD were horrible. I missed 90% of my classes and prelims, stopped responding to profs and blockmates, and attempted to take my life twice because I was certain that I had to either pull through college right then and there, or die. At one point, it started to affect my physical health too.

I've been doing therapy and meds since then. I wanted to go to a different online program, but that didn't pull through. So, I have to go back to campus this semester (August), and I can't afford to fall behind again. I can imagine how disappointed and angry my parents would be, after I've cost them so much money over the past year... but it's not really that I've stopped struggling with anxiety or suicide ideations and dissociation. I know that recovery isn't linear and I'm bound to have relapses, but I really cannot mess up.

Has anybody been in, or is going through this situation or anything similar? I'll gladly take any advice on coping and adjusting back into a campus setting, or even just stories about how it was like, when you returned - whether negative or positive.

Despite the therapy and meds, I somehow still feel like the same person. I've got my life held together for the time being, but that's because I was able to get rid of my biggest stressor - which was college and academics and having to constantly socialize or be perceived. I'm afraid of what I might do to myself when I return to the same place that ripped me apart.",13tudn6,jabee_chekemjoe,1685259528.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tudn6/advice_for_returning_to_college_after_a_mental/,,Depression

Voluntary isolation,0,"I remember, many months ago, maybe years, a twitter thread from a girl talking about her decision to never have close friendships, to only have acquaintances. Her point she made was that because of complex trauma syndrome, she found herself to be self sabatoging inadvertently, and that her inability to trust created issues at every corner of life.  
I feel the same now, and maybe even more than that.  
I’m disabled and my health is getting more complicated. I went on a trip to an old town Im from and realized all my friends had moved on and some considered me a nuisance. I was a mess when I lived there, going in and out of poverty, asking for help, now I was back just trying to visit.   
Back home in my current town I’ve realized I can’t make any close connections and am so very tired.  
I used to also be in the military and have trauma from that plus trauma from an extremely abuse ridden childhood.  
I asked my doctor the other day if it was ok to give up. Not to commit suicide, but to allow myself to just give in and give up, im already disabled and can’t go out much. I happen to also be lgbt and the country Im in just wants me to disappear.   
So I asked for permission form the only person who knows me(family doesn’t exist) if I can… clock out so to speak. And she said yes.  
Now I’ve decided to just be alone. I’ve decided to never date again and to never develop relationships with real people again.

Why did my friend group dump me after my breakup?,0,"I (F20) broke up with my boyfriend (M20). We were in the same friend group circle but we were all very very close with each other. But after our breakup, they still remained close friends whereas I got outcasted in my class as I don’t have any friends right now. 

I don’t have any motivation. 

No one to discuss in class.

No one to talk to in the morning.

For the first time I had a great group of friends. I was happy and content for the first time. But then everything went away in a moment.

I tried to reach out with my friends, but some said they ‘had a choice to make’ and the rest said nothing has changed. I just get ignored in my class, and I feel invisible. The rest of my classmates are also giving me hard time. My ex and some of them taunt me all of the time. I am feeling really miserable.

I still miss them. I miss the crazy memories we created and cherished. Those were my happiest moments in my life.

Now people avoid me like a plague…I became from the most popular kids to one of the outcasts…also my grades are plummeting. Now no one want me to include in their groups. I can’t seem to move on.

I remain very depressed…How to deal with this?",13ttyza,YouCan_KissMyAxe,1685257979.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ttyza/why_did_my_friend_group_dump_me_after_my_breakup/,,Depression
"""I just want to feel good about myself""",0,"The title of this post is from a quote from bojack horseman, and even tho bojack himself isn't a character to be admired or praised, I really relate to his character, especially with his sense of self-hatred, depression and a sort of ""fetishisation"" of his own sadness. 

But unlike him, I don't want to ""fetishise my depression"" and be content just using my depression and mental problems as an excuse for the stupid shit I've done, I know I can do so much more and improve upon myself. Life has thrown quite a few curveballs at me this year, I got an conditional offer from a really good university, got a girlfriend, then things didn't went well and we broke up, and ended up breaking her heart and possibly flunking my finals and failing to meet my offer due to my indolence. I want to improve myself, I want to wake up everyday and be excited about life instead of feeling like shit and wanting to just end it all. I want to change.

So, I need you all to hold me accountable, I want to have some sort of order and schedule in my life, I want to stop being addicted to PMO and improve myself, and I want to workout consistently. There's a long summer ahead of me and I do not intend to waste it.

I hide everything that I’m going through. As great as family is you can’t always tell them your problems because they don’t understand. I’ve been to therapy which didn’t really help. I just wish I had someone to listen without judgement. I’ve also had crippling anxiety for awhile now which makes it hard to go out and meet people and make conversation.

Can somebody please help me make sense of my feelings...,1,"Growing up, my mother was emotionally and verbally abusive. She made me feel like I was never enough, constantly calling me a spoiled brat, telling me I'd never amount to anything. This was because I never performed well in school, I didn't do my homework, and had no motivation to succeed. My father, on the other hand, when he was around, tried to encourage me and push me to be the best I can be. Unfortunately, my mother was the primary caregiver as my father was always working.

  
I didn't do good in high school, in fact I barely graduated. My mother constantly berated me while my father tried with what little strength he could muster to keep our family together. My mother also kept my sister and I separated for the majority of our childhood. My mother favored my sister immensely, and my sister always felt guilty about it. I never had a relationship with my sister until recently.  
Around the time I was 16 years old, I expressed my intention to my mother to join the Army. My mother was furious. She called me every name in the book until I finally had enough and agreed that I wouldn't do it, and that I'd go to college instead. Halfway through my senior year, I began my covert efforts behind my parents' back to enlist into the Army Reserves. 

  
Halfway through my recruitment process, my mother found out. A huge fight broke out and my mother said I was wasting my life. I understand mothers want their kids to be safe... but it felt more like my mother was upset because I wasn't taking the path in life that she wanted. She said things like if anything ever happened to me in the Army that she wouldn't feel bad or attend my funeral, and that anything that happened was my own fault, and that I dug my own grave, etc.  
Fast forward to after I came home from training.

  
The relationship with my parents made a complete 180. I got a job when I got home, went off to college, and my parents and I got along great. My mother ""apologized"" for the things she said in a letter she wrote to me during Basic, and she even came to my graduation. For the most part, things with my mother have been fine. I even began rebuilding my relationship with my sister. It feels like everything in my life has come so far in such a short time.

  
When I went off to college... I was miserable. I had to drop out halfway through my first semester and I came home due to ""financial misunderstandings"" with the Army (they said they'd pay for it, they didn't, I was pissed and dropped out due to not wanting 9 billion dollars in student debt, figured out it was actually 50% my fault, oops). Since coming home, I've gotten a job as an EMT. I work for the local 911 service.

  
The reason I'm posting today is... I feel worthless.

  
I joined the Army because I wanted to serve my country. I became an EMT because I wanted to serve my community. But now I'm realizing that, I'm only doing all these things because of how worthless I feel. When I was little I saw soldiers, cops, firefighters and EMS personnel as heroes. I wanted to be that hero that I never had... but I never feel like I'm doing enough. I feel like I'm drowning in my own expectations. I've tried to tell my dad that I feel worthless, that I hate myself, that I need help... but he won't listen. I think he thinks I'm just fine, that I don't need any help. I don't know how to tell him differently.

  
Due to the nature of my upbringing I've always kept everything inside, letting it out with some tears at night occasionally. I don't know how to let people in. I don't know how to tell this to anyone else. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I don't know how I can go about my life, just forgetting all the horrible things my mother did to me. She's never apologized... because I've never told her how I felt.

  
Why do I feel so worthless? Why do I hate myself so much? I don't know what to do or how to make sense of how I'm feeling. I can't find a therapist, I have no one to talk to. I don't know how to let people in. I'm really lost here.",13ttgab,justyouraverageboot,1685255999.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ttgab/can_somebody_please_help_me_make_sense_of_my/,,Depression
I need to get something off my chest. Im struggling,0,"Like I know people are gonna say get therapy and Ive tried but it doesnt really seem to help. Also in UK theres waiting lists of up to a year and I had it not too long ago so cant reapply yet. But I need help. And it is fitness related. Forgive me if this is not allowed here but I need to open up and this community might, and i mean might, understand a little. Probably not but i do t have many options

Im 39 m from uk. .  All my life ive loved muscular women. To be hoenst i dont even find normal women attractive even pretty ones. To me they always needed to be muscular. Unfortunately ive never known a muscular woman. Any time a regular woman and i have talked and they wanted to try and date i just couldnt .  Yes more than looks matter but i just dont think id be happy or satisfied and even end up resentful

Over time looks fade so i know that muscles wont last forever. But id love to be with a woman who was strong at least for a while and the personality will be there when muscles dont.  I know people say im aiming too high but look at say ida bergforth. It feels so unfair her boyfriend met her yet i cant find a single one.

Im forever single. Ive never been kissed even nevermind sex. Im 39. Its sad.  Its lonely. I could have dated some regular women if i wanted but if i did id feel like shit because my heart wouldnt have been into them. Id have been doing it purely out of lonliness and nobody deserves to be someones second choice or just there as a blanket against lonliness.  Id never do that to someone. So ive suffered alone rather than just make someone else miserable too.

I try to meet muscular women but thats another problem. Im obese. Im 122 kg.  I have lost 10kg since jan.i decided then to get fit to try and meet someone because it was silly expecting muscular women to want a fat depressed guy, and i was doing well for a while. But the depression and lonliness kicked i. Two months or so bad and ive struggled since. I stopped caring and realised ive left it so late in life and even if i did get fit i dont know where to even meet a fit muscular woman. None go to my gym its all average and online i get ignored.

Idk im struggling with lonliness. I just hate how hard life is. I also have suffered major depression and have a learning disability so i feel like im fighting a losing battle and dont know what to do.

Im cross posting this to a few places so forgive me if you see this elsewhere. I guess i just want to get it off my chest. I dont expect any sympathy or anything i just needed to say something because i feel like im going insane and cant do a thing about it.

I guess things does get better eventually.,2,"I've suffered from depression since I was 17 and now I'm 23. I was an addict for many years and I completely fucked my life. I decided to get sober a couple years back after my addiction made me slip into a psychotic episode that lasted almost 7 months. I was severely depressed again and I  isolated myself from the world completely. Went off grid and spent everyday alone in my room for about a year. I literally spoke to no one. I gained a lot a weight and was covered in acne. I  completely lost myself and I didn't even feel human. I dropped out of college didn't have a job and was basically useless in everyway possible. I wanted to die and the only thing that got me through the days was imagining myself dying. I had truly given up on life. I became obsessed with committing suicide. Somedays I would just lay in bed holding a knife. I'm sure everyone on this sub can relate to the mental torture that comes with depression and how self hatred literally possesses your entire being. I would get anxiety attacks that last hours everyday. The point is I was in hell and I couldn't see a way out other than death. But slowly something changed. I started coping by muffling the thoughts in my head. Its easier said than done and it took a lot of time but It worked. At first I could barely form a coherent thought in my head that wasn't related to how much of a piece of shit I am but with enough distraction somehow the voices got less intense. I forced myself to laugh. In the beginning it felt hollow and unnatural but as time goes on it started being genuine. I spent a lot time hanging out with my little brother and although he knew I wasn't ok, I didn't let my depressed side show. The time I spent with him was reserved for the part of me that was still capable of acting normal. We watched anime together, go for walks, cook food. These little moments of normalcy slowly made me felt more human. I was struggling everyday still but I allowed myself to forget about my depression momentarily when I was around family. It was difficult but having a break from my constant suicidal ideation was a necessary relief. After a few months things got a little better. I made a little goals for myself but I didn't pressure myself to achieve them. I just did what I could and acknowledged whatever progress I made. Eventually I reached out to some friends again. I started going to the gym, built a routine to keep my days somewhat organized. The depression is still there hanging around in the background but I managed to get back some of the personality I lost. Some days are still hard but somehow I know things will get better and there really is no rush for anything. I let go of the immense pressure and standard I set for myself and whatever happens, it happens. Honestly exercising was so difficult but it saved my life. One day I woke up and I just told myself that I'm tired of torturing myself and being sad. I know that sounds dumb but somehow something just clicked. I recently met someone and I'm happier than I've ever been in a long time. I know the world feels like it's ending when we're going through depression but if u asked me 8 months ago where I imagined I would be right now, I would have said a casket. Things do get better. I lost my shit so many times over the years but I still haven't given up hope. Just hold on. I'm not thriving yet but I know I'm getting there. I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore and I don't cry anymore. Most days I don't even feel the depression. It's there and I still suffer from some physical symptoms but I'm okay 80% of the time. It took me about 2 years to remember what feeling ok is like but its achievable. All I can say is it does get better eventually.

My mom takes my phone when I'm depressed and it just makes me more depressed.,2,"I'm 16 and when I get those days where I just want to die so I sleep in really late so my mom takes my phone and computer and then I just lose all will to live and I lay there the entire time even more depressed. So then I get it taken away even longer and then I just give up and lay starving myself until she gives it back. 

I hate the cycle. She is the type of person who says ""just be happy"" and then yells at me when I say it doesn't work like that. 

I hate the cycle so much and without my computer and phone I'm useless and I have nothing to distract me from my suicidal thoughts except sleeping. And I will just lay there and just not eat and then get sick because I'm not eating. Once I finally break free I eat a lot and then I'm fine and then I get my phone and computer back and then the cycle repeats until I get depressed again. My mom doesn't understand taking away the one thing I love to make me motivated makes me less motivated.

She keeps saying a version of ""just get/be ____"" like just be happy or just get motivated. She doesn't understand what I'm going through. She was saying she might just kick me out of the house until I feel better because I'm bringing too much negative energy into the house. 

Every day is the exact same. And it's a loop of the last day with almost no variation and I'm going insane. 

I wake up at like 12-4pm. I do online school. She gets home and we sometimes do something. Then after that at like 6 we eat dinner and then we watch TV until like 9, she goes to sleep. I stay up in bed and play on my phone until like 4am.

"Mold in my dirty depression pit, i need help",4,"My room rn is the dirtiest my space has ever been. Old dishes stacked on my desk, clothes and other items on the floor. 

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve found mold on the dishes, food on the ground from weeks before. 

I’ve been able to clean off the desk, and clean all the dishes in the past, but after that I’m usually exhausted and the dishes stack up again.

I’ve looked up many different ways to clean for ppl with adhd/autism/depression and I will clean while watching my comfort shows. 

The biggest issues for me are: starting to clean (it’s hard to start a task but once I get into it it’s fine), and then continuing to clean after I take a break/go to the bathroom/eat. 

I can hyper focus on cleaning for several hours, but then I won’t clean a thing for weeks because I’m tired of cleaning. 

*ps, I have physical disabilities/chronic pain. Also I was raised in an abusive household where I was told I was “dirty,” “disgusting,” and “no one will marry you if you live in a pigsty,” and all those things were told to me when my room was messy, but not dirty, now my room is actually dirty and I think causing me health issues*

I’m considering throwing out many of the dishes also. 

I need to know: 
How do I start? Do I do my laundry first? Throw out the trash? Is there a guide online for people who weren’t taught how to clean? Is there a way I can make it fun? 

Any and all comments help as long as it’s not shaming me, I will answer any questions, I just feel lost and alone rn and not sure how to fix this.

I feel like I'm worse at everything compared to my friends and people my age,1,"I feel like I'm a failure. I have few friends, I'm useless at making new ones, and I'm really slow going through university, whereas my friends are 1 semester away from graduating I'm still 3 away. I feel like I'm not good enough. I waste my time constantly and rarely get things done, and when I start I usually last a short time before stopping. I'm pretty much 23 and never even gone on a date. I feel like I've wasted most of my life so far, since I turned like 15 my life has gone pretty much downhill. 

Most of my hobbies are no longer interesting or fun to me.

I've done some things to try and get better, like tyding up my room the best I could (still a mess but much better) started doing some exercise, but I still don't feel much better, or like they've done any good I can notice, I still feel hopeless.

I'm afraid of becoming independent and having only myself to rely on. I still live with my parents, it's extremely normal in my country to move out later.

I feel like I take some steps forward and then stumble back to where I was. I hope I ever get out of this situation but I don't see the path.",13trhb5,pyropera,1685248592.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13trhb5/i_feel_like_im_worse_at_everything_compared_to_my/,,Depression
Alone & Lonely,0,"I feel soooo alone. People will automatically say, ""oh it's depression"" or some other mental illness but honestly, it's more than that. I'm not just alone, I'm lonely. Extremely lonely; and if that's not a reason to gain one then I don't know what is. To make it worse, the only type of people I attract are narcissist and people filled with their own selfish agenda.

I guess I'm textbook for 6 types of loneliness: New-situation loneliness, I’m-different loneliness, No-sweetheart loneliness, No-animal loneliness, Untrustworthy-friends loneliness and Quiet-presence loneliness. I moved away from my ""family"" for a better life because living there I was an afterthought. I'm such a family person and it seems like no one values that word as much as I do. I've always been different, sort of a loner so I gravitated toward people who I thought would protect me. That never quite worked. In return I felt less protected and more pushed away. 

So during the years I'd acquire pets and partners to fill that void, but nothing ever really stuck. In return the animals were a temporary fill, and the partners were broken souls trying to heal through me. I've tried having genuine friendships. Most even telling me I'm too emotional therefore I'd distance myself or ghost them to avoid backlash. 

I thought getting married would help build my own family Not at all. I'm just as lonely. My partner never wants to hang out with me outside the home or even at home. Seems like I'm tolerated. That's the quiet presence loneliness. It's a horrible feeling.

Yes, I've had therapy, don't do drugs, currently has a therapist, meditate, exercise religiously, is financially stable, try to be physically social outside my home, even has a social media following. But nothing helps. I'm too afraid to let people close to me anymore because I always get hurt. 

I don't feel like I belong here. I'm drained. I don't want to sleep forever, I just want to wake up to a life where I'm genuinely loved, my heart is heard & I'm fully accepted for me.",13trc5w,Positive_Mission2,1685248109.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13trc5w/alone_lonely/,,Depression
"Anxious, depressed and traumatized by work; what would you do if you were me?",1,"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate/severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy and helplessness; in the first week, it was even hard to get out of my bed. Whenever I think about work, I experienced an immense sense of anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and of course found it extremely difficult to work, or even think anything about work.

Recently, I've been taking a month off work, been in therapy and have fixed some parts of my life (mostly living healthier, through exercise, diets, sleep, meditation), but recovery has not been linear (some days are better, some days are worse), and the intense anxiety and fear around work remains. I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety. At the moment, I don't know how I could get back to work at all.

Will sectioning myself help,0,"TW: mention of suicide and eating disorders

tldr: will sectioning myself actually help? (in england where the NHS is shit) What will they do, will I get to talk to a psychologist and possibly (finally) get a real diagnosis and/or medication? Can someone be just too mentally ill to be helped. Could I be a lost cause.

I'm in the UK, I want to know basically what will happen if I take myself to A&E and section myself. I've been thinking about it for a while... what will they do? Keep an eye on me for a bit then send me home? Will I get to talk to a psychologist and seek proper diagnosis and or medication? Or will I just waste a few days, risk loosing my job and come out no better than I did going in? I've been fighting for MONTHS now to get the help I need. I have an ED that's only getting worse, and getting worse faster by the week. Severe depression, anxiety, PTSD and recently frequent panic attacks on top of my near constant anxiety attacks. I'm VERY suicidal but no intentions, just ideation. Constantly. I'm in therapy and have been for a good few months, it's helped a little but I feel like I need more? I just need medication really, or to know whats wrong with me. Why my anxiety is so severe. I need real specialised help with my eating disorder. I've done everything you're meant to do to help depression and anxiety. And I still desperately want to kill myself, nothing I do helps. it's almost constant thoughts. Detailed hypothetical plans, a blatant disregard for my own safety like I'm trying to stage accidents for myself but it's very half hearted cause I don't want anyone else to suffer or feel guilty etc etc. I can't kill myself but fuck I want to. What would a hospital do with this information, keep me in for longer? If I'm stuck for a while I risk loosing my job then I will be at a huge risk of actually following through... unless I go to live with family but then my housemate is left fucked trying to cover my half of rent... shits just shit and messy and shit and I don't fucking know what to do. I'm scared I will hurt myself but getting help feels like a risky option. And if getting help doesn't even help that's pretty much my last desperate resort and idk what I'd do after that.

Is there any way to be content with being alone?,1,"Hey

I was just wondering if someone went though the same process and was able to find happiness just by themselves.

I was in a long distance relationship for 6 years, since she ended it I have been really miserable. I truly loved her and never thought she would leave me.

I did try finding friends in person and online but maybe I just don’t know how to talk to people because I haven’t been very successful. I don’t feel it’s because of lack of trying because I do try to be a good conversationalist. Maybe I am doing something wrong without even realizing it but it has been tiring and I kind of want to stop and learn to be okay just by myself.

It has been particularly difficult since loneliness is something that really gets to me. I had a pretty lonely childhood and it probably contributes to that but that’s something for my therapist to figure probably.

Since I can remember, I have always tried to make and be a good friend. I also tried to find love and be a good partner. I know I am not perfect, I have made a lot of mistakes but after 27 years it feels really heartbreaking to be completely and utterly alone.

It’s been really lonely lately, I don’t really have anyone and it’s been really overwhelming. My family lives in another country and I don’t really have any friends at all.

I mostly spend my days alone, I have been trying to go out more and work on myself.

So I just wanted to know if someone have some tips or suggestions? Any activity that I can do or some hobby that I can take up to be okay with being just by myself?

I would really appreciate any help.

Depression After Injury,2,"Hi everyone, I hope this is an appropriate place to post this. November of last year I had a bad car accident and broke my pelvis on both sides and 7 ribs. I was very lucky in that I was pretty much otherwise okay. I had two major surgeries to fix my pelvis and have plenty of pins and plates, etc. The total 26 day stay in the hospital and rehab center was pretty traumatic but I had/have amazing support in my fiance and family. 

I came home in December last year, and I could not bear weight for 3 months. I was either in bed or my wheelchair. Used a commode for toilet. Fiance had to do basically everything for me, sleep was awful (in hospital and at home) and it was a hell I would not have survived without my fiance. 

All that to say it is now May, I am in physical therapy and I no longer use a wheelchair or a walker, I can walk. I am eternally grateful. But my walk isn’t normal yet and I can’t walk/stand for long because it causes awful back pain on the left. 

I can’t work right now. I’m home all day. It’s difficult to stand to cook/clean so I can’t even pitch in much around the house. I’m painfully bored and feel useless. I can’t bend at the knees or do any sort of squat or even put on my own socks (from being bedbound and unable to bend my legs like that for so long). I know these things should improve, but I don’t feel like me! Every step is hard, every trip to the bathroom, the kitchen wherever is hard. I can’t go to a store and walk around for long. 

I try to talk to my fiance or mom about how depressed and unlike myself I feel. I just get the “you are so lucky, etc” which I know that I am, I could have died! But I’m depressed. I feel like I’m in some kinda weird prison with no where to go. And I feel like I’m stuck in my body because I know how to walk but I just can’t do it right or for long. 

Sorry this was so long, not sure if anyone will read it all. I just feel so sad all the time, and a listlessness that is like…in my bones, no pun intended.

Apart from them the world has hated me since I was in school.  in my current job they don't talk to me and act behind my back.  They betrayed me after I taught them everything.  I once helped a homeless man and gave him food.  back he assaulted and robbed me.  how to be in life?

its getting out of control,1,"my depressive episode is just getting worse and more tiring. for 2 months now i am almost emotionless everyday. i havent laughed in a long time. every time i drive home from the gym, work or uni i sit in my car for 30 seconds holding back tears before heading inside. i used to routinely clean my room every week. i havent cleaned my room in a month now.

im so tired. uni is killing me. every day im stressing out about somethnig, uni, work, or my dads cancer. im letting down people around me. my uni group has noticed a drop in quality from my contributions in our assignments. i tell them im really busy and ill get the rest done later but in reality i cant focus because im extremely unmotivated.

my insomnia is fucking with me even harder. everyday i wake up too early with racing thoughts, heavy heartbeat. blood tests come up with nothing wrong. 

its getting out of control. no one else knows how fucked my mental health is at the moment. my friends, family and coworkers still see the good old me as usual.

the only time where these thoughts go away is in the gym, i wish i had more energy so i can workout for more than an hour.

I’m not going to bed tonight / A lover,0,"I am just going to sleep on the sofa at my parents’ house. Not because I don’t have the strength to go to bed, but because I hate myself extremely.
I am an empty frustrated lonely nothingness with no dignity to others or to myself.
Everytime that it gets a little better, once the newness has passed, I get hit in the face by the fact that I do not belong to this world. 

Tomorrow I’ll take my pills as usual. All this is because I drank like an idiot last night?

Everyday since a couple weeks ago I chat with or call this girl who lives 10000 away. I haven’t told anyone. She’s cute and kind and extroverted and we talked a lot over a couple weeks. She said she likes me and complimented me a number of times.
I had nothing to lose and showed myself completely vulnerable and weak, but she did not go away. I felt some positive things that I think I had not even experienced before in my life.
I like to imagine that I could have a different life if only I got to be with her. 

I just want to be honest as we promised, but recently it feels like I play a part when I talk to her. If she just got to know how completely empty I am,… and I think she is starting to see that. She sees that I can’t keep up with the part anymore. That I am not the kind of actor that is able to do more than a short mediocre cabaret play once in a while.



I don’t want to be completely alone again.



I am crying now and I felt something for a moment. I don’t want to feel nothing unless I drink - it’s just a sensation then, and it always lasts too little.

I will just disappoint everyone again tomorrow. They expect that from me, and I am a fool for trying to forget my past. They have not forgotten. Or, maybe, they just don’t care. If I don’t look too sad, they can go on with their lives and a clean conscience.



Why would someone willingly create all this pain? And no way out, no way out, no way out at all. Life will pass in desperation and every attempt to be free will be vain until then. 



There is no comfort in death for someone who has not lived. Desperation right to the last breath, and not knowing what kind of pain will come after that.













I just want to believe something different but I can’t today. I just want to go to bed. I just want not to have to write this, or fuck up my routine, just to feel something at all.

Husband. I know I’m scaring him and hurting him but I cannot stop these feelings. I cannot soothe myself. I feel so much hopelessness and dread about being alive. I would rather die than feel this way. 

I started drinking and smoking cigarettes again, which I quit after my last depressive episode. 

I was able to get an alprazolam subscription from a walk in clinic physician but I’m almost out and I’m so afraid of going on without that crutch. 

The only time I feel okay is when I mix my Xanax with alcohol. It’s the only time I feel like I can go on. But it’s so short lived and then I have to wake up and feel like shit all over again.

I'm not okay,2,"I don't even know how to start this. I am just generally not well. I don't know if it is depression or something else, as I've never seen a therapist, but it's been going on for years. The last couple years it has been getting worse. I don't think this can be fixed with just talking to someone. My brain feels like it has been slowly dying or turning to mush.

My thoughts aren't as clear anymore, I forget a lot of stuff, learning has started to become impossible. Sometimes I just find myself feeling confused, but not sure what i'm confused about. It is like the feeling you get when you enter a room but forget why, but without going to another room.

My grades at uni have been horrible, and i'm failing almost all of my classes. I feel like life is just happening, and I don't feel much for it anymore. I struggle to get out of bed for classes, and nobody really cares if I don't. 

I felt like I started to crawl out of this hole last year, and during my birthday in december I felt like things we're going to be okay for the first time in a long while. The day after my birthday my girlfriend of 6.5 years broke up with me, which kicked me back into the hole again. I can't do this again.

After the breakup my mind started screaming, and it took months to calm down. I don't know how to describe it other than literal screaming. Random thought just getting yelled, sometimes multiple at the same time. I can usually distract myself using videos or games but I can't learn like that, and I can't sleep like that. When i'm laying alone in bed the thoughts are loudest, and I have to distract myself until I'm tired enough to fall asleep, which is often quite late.

I know I should get help, but I can't. I haven't been able to do too much, apart from things I like. I know how that sounds, and I am not sure myself if I'm just a lazy shit. I can't do my dishes, which means they just pile up in my room. I don't take out the trash, which means it smells horrible. I don't shower often, which means I'm greasy, and i hate it. I don't do the stuff i'm supposed to do, and I don't know why.

I'm not okay, and I don't even know if this text is coherent enough for you guys to read through. I don't know what is happening with my mind, but it feels like it's broken.

"""Friends"" went on an ignorant, judgmental tangent about depression being nonsense, etc",68,"Two nights ago I went to two friends' house. (They are a couple). Somehow, we ended up on the topic of psych meds. The three of us have been friends for 8 years, and I have always LOVED them, in part because I thought they were open-minded and kind. So this shocked me:

One of them (the man) asked when I started taking antidepressants, and I replied, ""17."" With an absolutely disgusted look on his face, he asked, ""17?! Has it occurred to you that EVERYONE is depressed at 17?! It's called ADOLESCENCE."" He then segued into, ""I know I'm gonna sound like a conspiracy theorist but..."" and launched into a monologue about how psychiatrists are ""quacks"" and that people don't NEED antidepressants. He said they are ""unnecessary, addictive drugs"" and that at age 27, our brains aren't even fully developed. ""Some people,"" he elaborated, ""think they're bipolar and then one day they wake up and aren't bipolar because their brains have developed."" Dude... what?!

Then it was time for his gf to chime in. She asked if I wanted to be ""hooked and dependent"" on meds forever. I said that if I need them, yes. I told her that if someone is diabetic, they take insulin, so how exactly is this different? She said, ""because diabetes is a real, physical illness."" Hmm... depression must be fake? Wow, good to know! I'm so happy I had them to educate me!! /s

I didn't want to respond with anger. I've had a tough week and didn't want to get upset, especially because they've been my friends for so long. But the more I think about it, the more I think, ""fck you."" I've dealt with treatment-resistant depression my entire life (It runs in my family-- I lost a parent to suicide as a child). And yet, because of meds, I've managed to make a life for myself of which I am proud. Two people who are LUCKY enough to have never dealt with mental illness (it is an ILLNESS, and not having to deal with it doesn't make someone better that anyone else!) is going to sit there and judge me for taking medication that HAS SAVED MY LIFE?! 

Anyway, does anyone else have stories like this? And I wonder how many people in the US actually think this way.... I think we've made tremendous strides in terms of mental health education/discussion, but maybe not as much progress as I thought...

Too scared to be alone,2,"Hi, I F(24) have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. Sorry if I make a mistake,but english is my second language. 
For 4 years I've been living in fear.. I tried to get over it,but everytime it came back even worse. After some episodes in my life,I developed a fear of being alone and around men. I can't take public transportation,I can't walk alone anywhere,I can't take my dog for a walk or just sit in front of my house,I can't go nowhere if I'm alone. When I try to push myself and go somewhere I am in constant fear and my brain starts to shift in fight or flight response,because all I can think,hear and see is that I'm in danger. At first there were some thoughts,like someone can attack me,or stalk me,then they appered more often,then every single day,from morning to late night. They started to get more aggresive and louder,someone could kiddnap me,r*** me,k*** me,etc,then I started to get paranoia of men doing these things to me,that someone is always stalking me,always listening on me. I always look behind me,I always run when I need to go somewhere,I am afraid. Last year the images started.. I started to see people following me,hearing someone calling me,when there was no one,listening to people walk by my door hoping that no one tries to break in,covering my laptop's and phone's cameras,calling someone to talk to me while I'm alone in my appartment. From the moment I wake up,to the moment I fall asleep,this is all I can think about,I try not to,but it feels like my brain has his own choices,like I can't control it anymore. I miss the days when I wasn't afraid,when I can go out by myself.. but now I feel like my mind has trapped me in my own body,always living in fear of the unkown,men and my safety. I know that these thoughts aren't real,but when I go outside they start to feel so real to me,that I can't even realise what is real and what is not. I started therapy and medication,the thoughts are gone for now,I can go alone to a shop,near my home and walk my dog in front of my house,but that's it,when I try to go somewhere else,they are back... I can't go see my family beacause I'm scared to be alone in a train,I can't meet up with my friends if they would not come by my house to get me ,I can't have a job if it's not near my house,I still can't do most of the necessary things to get my life back.. It took me 4 years and 8 months to be able to leave my appartament by myself,without fear. I push myself as hard as I can,I know that it must take time to be able to get back to who I was before.. but I am really tired of this life.. Traped in my own body, by my fears and not being able to leave my home when I want to.. I feel stuck like a fly in a spider's web.

Im 26M losing in life don’t know how to keep myself going,2,"
It started from my childhood. I was getting beaten up in secondary school and overall disrespected regularly. I’ve had videos taken of me because I’d try out new hairstyles at that time or I’d find myself just getting beaten up by the bigger weight lifting guys. 

Fast forward to age 26, I’ve kept tabs on specific bullies who went out their way to make sure I suffered and they’re all doing amazing. One of the guys who would ALWAYS record me when I was getting beaten up and then would come to slap me for no reason is doing well. He’s in shape, looks like Christian Ronaldo, has a solid group of friends, has two degrees in economics and finance, a decent looking gf, started a side business & landed a solid position at a big firm back in my hometown.

The others are doing just as well and it makes me angry. I was skinny in high school (waist size 29 inches) now I’m obese (waist size 44 inches). I use to have a six pack and not as miserable. Im fighting self delete thoughts constantly, have 0 friends, just got a job that’s below average wage where I’m living, haven’t finished school yet because I keep dropping courses from mental illness, having spoken to my family in two years because they are narcissists who blame me for everything, never had a gf & just overall miserable.

I’ve been eating junk food everyday for the last nine months bc I can’t cook. I don’t want to be here anymore and I hate how they got away with all the abuse they inflicted on me. If anyone heard my story in real life they’d probably side with the bullies bc they look slick and oversell look more likeable than i do. I blame them for my mess.

I don't think I'll make it to the end of the year,1,"A year ago I was relatively happy, but everything has slipped away. My relationship has become toxic and loveless. Once that ends I'll be homeless, and can't afford my own place. 
Work was well, but that's changed. I'm not valued by the right people. The Company doesn't give a shit about any of us. The work I want to do is put if reach. Its getting harder and harder to go to work. 
Everything feels pointless. A few months ago I thought I found my '""calling""- something I was good at, and made me feel good. It feel I was put on this planet to be pushed down, teased and have it taken away. 
I'm destined to be alone, to be miserable, and i hate it. 
What is there to live for? Things are bad and they get worse, and worse. Then they get worse. It's like salt in a wound, then the wound is torn open again. And before either can be healed its poked and hurts more. 
I break down most days, usually hiding away but recently I've gotten good at hiding it in plain site - I'm at work, and I'm crying but no one can see. I've stopped trying to hide it. And no one notices. The people I want to help don't even acknowledge me. 
One person gave me some help and I've ignored it. I don't know why. I don't know who I am anymore. I spent years building a person I could be proud of, but that's gone. What's left? A bitter and twisted ball of anger and hate. 

 I hate this person. I've tried so hard to be something good, but this world is adamant that's not to be. I'm a terrible person and I deserve every bad thing. .

"I feel like my brain is ""unclipping"" or like it's hit a corrupt file. I don't have a better way to explain this.",1,"Hi, I've really given up with the mental health services and I don't know where else to go. I have this ""thing"" that happens, I've told the mental health people in my area about it but they shrugged it off and suggested I try talking therapy.  

I don't know if some brief background would be helpful so including it anyway. Fake account for obvious reasons. 

So uh I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was about 13-14 when I was falling behind in my lessons, not being able to do the work, I was getting bullied and I was being groomed online by several different men over like 4 years.

I've been in two very unhealthy relationships and assaulted in both ways by them and had some huge family issues because of one of the relationships I was in (cut off from speaking to my parents, mental abuse, gaslighting etc). I've also been assaulted by one man I met on tinder as an adult.

I've tried medication, CBT, just talking therapy, DV counseling, private therapy. This has all been happening since I was in school when I was referred to CAMHS. I'm also on a waiting list to be seen about ADHD, autism.

Okay sorry, I'm not trying to make this too long. 

So to my ""issue"", about a year and a half ago, I was out walking my dog when I had to sit down in a field because I felt like I was going to ""fall off the world"", I had this severe anxiety that my brain/sanity was slipping away or ""unclipping"". It lasted about half an hour then I continued to have little episodes where I would ""slip out"" for a moment, it was like my body was not mine, comprehending my hands/arms/body was difficult then I would come back and I felt dizzy, anxious, upset etc.

It eventually went away and I stopped feeling it but over the last few weeks, I've been feeling it again. It's a very familiar feeling in the back of my head. I've started dissociating again, struggling with understanding myself, feeling overwhelmed with the idea of being alive/real person. It's such a dull ache and I can't put my finger on the feeling, I don't know how to properly describe it. Nothing I have put here can possibly match how it actually feels.

It scares me. It makes me feel like I'm one step away from becoming unhinged but then I manage to have normal moments, I can speak on the phone or do the dishes.

Please, I'm desperate to feel a trace of normal and the gps/mh don't want to know. Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?

She tried to downplay it and me being anti confrontation went with it our of reflex. Still, even in this conversation she didn't apologize. 

As far as I remember the only time she apologized was once for a fight that was indeed very obviously her fault and for little, meaningless stuff that I couldn't give less of a shit for. 

I now live with my father and my life has been way better ever since, even though it comes with it's own sets of problems. 
She asked me recently if I loved her and i said a little bit. Idk if it's true but if it is, it's probably irrational and I concealed that I I mostly feel scron and hatred for her. 

It's not like she never does thing's for me, just that she doesn't seem to actually care or be there for me when I need(ed) it.

Over the years I keep going through cycles where things are ok for a while and then it all goes to shit. I manage to climb back up, and I get pushed right back down. 

From 2017-2019 I was in a major depressive state after my divorce. Ended up jobless in 2018 because I couldn’t handle my full time office job. But by the end of that year I was working part time again and going to therapy, and things started getting better. 2020 was weirdly my best mental health year in a very long time. So I started working full time again… and slowly the edges started cracking again. 2022 was awful and in April I ended up leaving my job again because it was my main point of stress, which was causing the depression to be worse. I naively thought I could do DoorDash for a couple of weeks and easily find something else part time and get myself back in order.

Well, as soon as I start trying to take orders I start having electrical issues. One of the battery cables needs replacing. And I have no money. I lost count of how many applications I’ve put in and have only heard back from 1. They said they would contact me to start the hiring process… and then didn’t. I’m doing deliveries sometimes at night to try and avoid having to turn the car off and on so much, but I’m still scared that I’m going to end up stranded.

And now the worst part of all, I’m going to have to euthanize my 16 yo cat. She has kidney disease and it seems to have advanced to a point where she is in pain and quickly losing quality of life.

And then I get up and return to doing my chores. Like a robot, like a souless mechanism. I don't want to do anything - life forces me. I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink, but my body wants it. I am a mind who can never just stop and grief, oh no. I have to crawl to work and then stuff my face, because I would starve otherwise. There is no real choice.

"I want to get better, I want to live, how much help should I expect from the healthcare system?",0,"I operate a small business in Banff Alberta guiding tours of the Canadian Rockies. It has been my dream job for the last 3 years. 

Depression has made me miss all kinds of opportunities in life, as early as 12 when I was first diagnosed. Now it may cause me to lose my business. 

Last month I started to have panic attacks and chest pains before giving tours and soon fell into a deep depression which saw me in bed for 20 hours a day. As soon as I started having to cancel tours I went to the doctor who prescribed me with Wellbutrin for the depression, nothing for anxiety. Canadian doctors are reticent to prescribe anything that could be addictive.

In the 3 weeks to the next appointment, I would have one grandparent die, one case of Covid-19 and 2 appointments with my therapist. Each appointment I asked for a referral to a psychiatrist and she agreed but said she was prevented from being able to book it due to a system error. 

The three week check up at the Doctor’s saw me worse than before I started the medicine. Wellbutrin made me dizzy and he told me to discontinue using it.
He left a message to my therapist to confer on a treatment plan including referring me to a psychiatrist and finding the correct antidepressants. He would call me as soon as he heard from my therapist. I felt relieved by the outcome of the appointment and it set a good tone for that night. 

I reached out 2 days later to the Doctor and scheduled a phone appointment for 2 pm. I was told he may call a little after 2 as the clinic is busy. I called at 3:50pm and was informed The doctor had left for the day and would not be returning until after the weekend. Without cancelling more work I would have to wait another week to talk to him. I felt deeply vulnerable in the worst week of my life.

Immediately after that I checked myself into the hospital where I was deemed “passively suicidal”. I asked the ER Psych about getting a referral to a psychiatrist and a prescription for antidepressants: what I had hoped to get from my doctor. The ER Psych recited a litany about the referral wait being three months long. She said I should probably just keep seeing my regular therapist and family doctor despite both of them agreeing I should see a psychiatrist. ‘Even if it’s a 3 month long wait list why not get on the list?’ I thought. As she changed the subject I felt disparaged for having even asked. I was given a prescription for clonazepam (anti-anxiety) and told to report to my family doctor for the prescription of a new antidepressant since ER doesn’t give prescriptions for long term meds. 

Before I left I asked again if she would refer me to a psych. Aloof as ever, she told me to ask my family doctor.  

I write this because I don’t know if I am asking too much of an understaffed healthcare system or if it’s reasonable to expect treatment that addresses all the symptoms I have experienced during this breakdown.",13tid8p,atetoomuchsugar,1685221957.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tid8p/i_want_to_get_better_i_want_to_live_how_much_help/,,Depression

"5 long, damning years.",0,"5 years.

It was 5 years since I had someone apart from my family who loved me. And each of those 5 years was excruciating pain.

Year 1 was fine and dandy. Year 2 was manageable. But since then, every year felt like the world was trying to claw and poke at me and see how long I last.

Heck, I was ready to jump at one point. But I don’t know why I didn’t. Life has been sh¡t since I said goodbye to her 5 years ago. I open social media and it’s all cute couples cuddling. It’s all tormenting and otherworldly pain.

Whenever I feel like I’m getting close, I make that final step and admit it to that someone and every time for the past 5 years I get mentally kneecapped and brought to a state of depression.

Most days my parents say stuff like “when are you going to bring that special someone home” and “it’s not so hard, come on” and I have to awkwardly keep my emotions suppressed. And then get told like “people get married at your age, where is your girlfriend”

I lock myself in my room every day and let those suppressed emotions out to The Chain by Fleetwood Mac or Bullet by Miyagi.

Citalopram Generic Switch - Help,1,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I have been taking generic citalopram (Celexa) from Torrent pharmaceuticals (40mg pink ovals) for about 3 years now and doing fine.

Didn't think much of it at the time, but a week later all my initial SSRI startup symptoms, plus the overwhelming anxiety, have all returned in full force. I am in complete and utter despair currently, suffering from extreme derealization. I have a fulltime job and kid to take care of, I can't have this happening. Already called the pharmacy and they told me their contract with Torrent ran up and I'm SOL.   
Any suggestions as to where to go from here are appreciated.. All I can think of is calling other pharmacies to see which generic they carry, maybe have my doctor write a new prescription..

Life is sad,1,"I'm not blaming my genes or my luck. It all could have been way better if I was a smart person and made actual good decisions. Anyway...

I have always had suicidal thoughts and have been a pessimistic person. But all those times I had some things in life which distracted me from those thoughts, and they worked. Maybe for 2-3 years, it has not been like that. The only reason I have not commited a suicide during this period is my family. They do not deserve this. They are very good people.

I sometimes think that a person has to be the worst loser to consider others when deciding whether to end their life or not. I mean, it is my life, yet, I cannot do it even though I know I have to.

Recently I start crying out of nowhere. I have become very sensitive. And I hate that I am trying so hard to hide these.

Still I am trying to find some pursuits in life and trying to hold on to dear life(: But every time I fail.

I have 2 friends and I love them. I think my relationship with them is also getting worse.

Actually, I have not been like this all the time. Maybe 6-7 years ago, I was actually very popular among my peers, and was very social. And of course I thought it was going to be that way all the time...

Maybe it is my brain tricking me to help me survive. Maybe at those times I was still a dumb fuck but I was a kid and no one bothered to say me anything. And my peers were also kid so they must have noticed my weirdness later.

It is really making me sad. As I am writing this paragraph I am crying desperately. Breathing intensely.

I have always taken good care of my health. Recently, though, I eat and drink things I wouldn't before.

As I have mentioned above, I was actually somewhat social 6-7 years ago. I had a lot of female friends, as a matter of fact, I barely even talked with guys. Now, I am only talking with guys and with none girls. I think this is also an indicator how much I have changed.

Of course I love hanging out with guys. But as a straight male, I feel the need to talk with women sometimes. And it was 3 years ago when I had a female friend...

Anyways. I know my last paragraphs may not mean much to you, or they can be seen less heavy. I just wrote these as the sentences came to my mind.

Sertraline weight gain,0,"About five weeks ago, I made a switch from taking 40mg of fluoxetine to 100mg of sertraline. Recently, I visited a renowned psychiatrist who decided to increase my sertraline dosage to 200mg. The reason for this change was due to my maladaptive disorder, which manifests as anxiety and dysthymia. I was experiencing panic episodes and excessive rumination, which led to the medication switch.

However, since starting the higher dose of sertraline, I've noticed a rapid weight gain, which is particularly concerning considering my struggle with binge eating disorder and obesity. I plan to reach out to my psychiatrist on Monday, but I'm unsure if they'll be willing to change my medication. If that's the case, I'm contemplating returning to fluoxetine since it's a familiar option, despite previous negative experiences with other antidepressants.

The weight gain, although I feel more emotionally stable, has started to impact my self-esteem. Do you have any similar experience? Thanks!",13tgssv,ellenn89,1685217910.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tgssv/sertraline_weight_gain/,,Depression

I’m a single parent who tries her best to give her kiddo everything. I’ve noticed lately how much my kiddo gravitates towards dads and how much he wants one. I’m also extremely jealous of my partnered parent friends and their ability to have hobbies and get out of the house once in awhile. It seems extremely unlikely I will ever have a partner because I’m so damaged, and I’m also so buried and burnt out by all I have to do at home and work that it’s impossible to have any me time or any fun.

I’m so incredibly overwhelmed at work. There is never enough time to get everything done and so much pressure (think small business owner). Every moment I don’t work I feel terribly guilty. Every moment I do work I feel is far behind and extremely inadequate.

I’ve been in therapy and on medication for years, and it feels like nothing is getting better. All that has happened is I’ve become more aware of my pain. I’m sinking deeper and deeper, and have less and less ability to function. I feel like I will keep sinking until I will finally break and quit my job, sell my house and possessions, and aimlessly live in a camper…. but that’s not realistic with a kid and several pets, so I’m stuck in this deep, dark, pit alone for the foreseeable future. I hate it.",13tfhn5,woohooali,1685214449.0,6,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tfhn5/i_am_so_deeply_sad/,,Depression
I’m genuinely so happy in life right now so why am I having suicidal ideation? MASSIVE TW,3,"I have been plagued with an image replaying in my head over and over for months of a bullet going through my brain. Anytime I feel stressed this image will pop into my head and almost serve as a coping mechanism to imagine everything just ending. But the thing is, if anyone asked me I would say I’m the happiest I’ve probably ever been in my life. I have 0 complaints right now, I feel safe, happy, loved, but this image has me feeling defeated. Will I just never be able to life free of suicidal ideation? I take medicine to help with depression and anxiety and it works so well for the most part.

Just turned 20… I hate myself,2,"My birthday was yesterday, it was the worst birthday of my life. I laid in bed and sulked the whole day. I’ve always dealt with depression but I can’t seem to overcome it this time. I don’t even want to get out of bed most days, I feel like I’m losing my mind. 

Things aren’t even going bad which is what makes it so much worse. I’m a college student with 2 majors and a minor, I have almost a full scholarship, I have a few good friends and am even looking at moving into my own apartment this upcoming fall. But I still hate myself and the thought of even going on. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I have developed a bad addiction to marijuana substances that stems from me trying to get my mind of things. I haven’t been sober a single day since Christmas and honestly probably since august besides a few days sprinkled throughout. I know I’ll get a lot of hate and people saying it all stems from that but it’s not. I’m sure it plays a factor but it’s not the full story. 

I don’t know what to do, I literally don’t have the strength to keep this charade up. People are expecting me to do great things but I just don’t have the ambition anymore. My body is falling apart, I’m constantly worried about my health but I’m too scared to do anything about it. I don’t even know why I’m posting this but maybe something will come of it. Have at me I suppose, I’m used to it, no one can say anything that will hurt me more than I do myself. I hate my own existence, I couldn’t care whether I died today or last week.

Waves of Unhappiness,0,"So, I’m not sure if I’m depressed or not at this point. I’m too afraid to go talk to someone about it since I’ve grown up dealing with my own issues privately and alone. 

I have a wonderful, caring mother that I love more than life itself, but I can’t imagine telling her how I feel sometimes. I don’t want to stress her out or make her feel like she failed when she did everything to make sure I lived the best life she could give me after my dad left when I was 6. 

I couldn’t ask her to do more and be more when she stretched herself so thin to give me the best of herself. I won’t break her heart, no matter how dissatisfied I feel with my own issues. 

I constantly feel like I’m not enough and that the work I put in at my place of employment, whether it’s 40, 50, 60 hours, I still get paid the same amount of cause of salary. And yes, I wanted the job to grow and get the experience and title, but I feel stuck. Stuck with college, with my job, with my constant feeling of inadequacy while friends of mine are getting married or buying houses. 

I’m still in my room, at my mom’s apartment at the age of because as a family unit (mom, stepdad, and I) can’t afford a house. And Lord knows I don’t get paid enough to live on my own, no matter how long I work. And I love my job because it’s important work that positively affects hundreds of people, but it’s also thankless. But here we are, my mom and stepdad are about to take a massive gamble to buy a house. Now, I gotta finish college, get a promotion, and maybe, just maybe… we might be able to afford a mortgage on top of electricity and water. Then there’s insurance, car insurance, and all of these constant, rising costs. 

But then there’s me. No idea what to do next. Perhaps I’m lazy to do what it takes, but I just wake up unhappy with moving forward cause I know I won’t find a spouse, or have a family, and my only goal left is to take care of my mom until she passes on to Glory. After that, when I’m truly alone, I won’t have much else. 

It really sucks because I am a Christian at heart. But it’s sucked objectively looking at my situation and putting my dreams in a box to be forgotten because their untenable. 

Astronaut? Too stupid. 
Attorney? Incapable.
Maybe run for office and try to fix problems in my community? Don’t have the money, probably impossible to get donors on my side, and don’t have the “special quality” of being a crook or a blatant liar to be an elected official. 

I just want to sleep most days, feigning excitement and joy with the people I care for. I wish I could talk to someone about this, but (in my own crazy way) I refuse to be “weak” in front of anyone. So it’s somehow easier not to say what I really think or feel and just fake it till I make it. I just hope I can make it, because if I don’t make it, I don’t know what I’ll do. 

I know it’s unhealthy to compare my life to others’ but it’s hard not to. And just saying “nah, do think that way” or “don’t do that” does not help. All of these things come in waves, it doesn’t matter if I’m alone or even surrounded by friends. I know I’m inadequate. I just hope I can foehn the joy and drive to keep going. 

I really hope that people out there live their best lives and aren’t wracked with similar thoughts.

i don’t even know,2,"i don’t know my purpose and i never have. twenty six years alive, most of which spent riding the wave, not knowing what comes next. calm waters can easily turn into a storm when you’re lost at sea. lately i’ve been trying not to drown, fighting to just survive at this point. i know it all sounds cliche but it’s the only simple way i know how to put it. i’m alone on a piece of driftwood because the boat i had was abandoned by all my crew and eventually myself. i left the boat only when i saw it started to sink, realizing i can’t do this all alone on my own anymore. i stayed and tried to remain faithful to my beliefs to keep this ship sailing, no matter what damage was caused along the way. i suppose the damage became substantial enough to cause my crew to eventually abort one by one. some left for other ships when they said they’d always be there. some didn’t want to repair the damage or take accountability for the damage they caused. i’ll admit i’ve pushed some overboard just to avoid being the one abandoned. i’ve cut so many ties along the way, but sometimes it has to be like that when your crew has a high turnover rate. all i’ve got left are trust issues and anxiety through the roof. 

on a non metaphorical note, the only social interaction i seem to get is with my therapist. i have absolutely no clue what to do with my life. i’ve spent my entire adult life since failing out of college just trying to support myself and fix my mental health, but it’s never got any easier. i’ve tried and quit and failed and tried again. working shitty job after shitty job, failed friendships and relationships all one after another. nothing ever stays the same in my life, even the depression gets worse. the people and things i enjoyed all eventually became intolerable. people stopped replying when i reached out, so i stopped reaching out and talking all together. just feeling complete abandonment by this point. the only reason i am even in therapy right now is because even my mother can’t tolerate me anymore. i’ve tried therapy on and off my whole adult life, and gave up on it after multiple therapists gave up on me. having hope this time is going to be any better is very slim, though i’m honest to fucking god sick of feeling the way i have for as long as i have. it’s costed me so many tears and years spent feeling miserable. it’s costed me jobs, friendships, and relationships. i want to enjoy my life and not be bitter when i see people in public enjoying theirs. i want to wake up and not wish i hadn’t. i want to live for myself, i want to love my life, i wish i had something more to live for, but i still don’t know how. i wish i didn’t believe the world would be better off without me. i wish there was a job that’s a good fit for me that didn’t make me hate my life even more. i wish i could convince myself that there’s something good i can offer, but everything that comes to mind just isn’t for me or is flat out impossible for me. ive always believed i shouldn’t exist, that my parents should have never even met. but i still wish i wasn’t alone and that someone in my life would be there, to listen and understand. i wish i had a real friend that wouldn’t abandon me because they don’t understand me, i wish they wanted to be around me. i wish i didn’t feel like i deserve to be left alone because i don’t know how to interact anymore. i feel like everything i do and say and feel is wrong. and i so badly wish i wasn’t like this.",13teejc,Acceptable-Rent3573,1685211616.0,3,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13teejc/i_dont_even_know/,,Depression

I don't know if I am depressed or just lazy,0,"Hi everyone!
I've always considered myself like a ""not very stable emotionaly"" type of guy, but recently things started to be really rough.
I finished my school year 3 weeks ago and now im looking for an internship, without succes.
I'm studying in a city which is very far from my family and most of my friends, but i need to stay there for the internship.

My sleep schedule is a mess:
Im a very energic habitualy, but recently i feel sleepy everytime. Yesterday i slept at 19 pm, while usally it is around 2 am.
3 days ago i fell asleep at 17 and i woke up at midnight. Honestly, everytime I fall asleep is at some random hours, and everytime it takes me by surprise.

I started to eat one meal each day, sometimes even none, just because it takes too much effort to cook and i feel like eating takes wayyyyy to long. Litteraly EVERY action i do between when i wake up and when i go to bed is a struggle and this feels very tiring.

Im always trying to go out with friends etc, but recently i refuse to hang out to bars and parties etc, which i NEVER refuse normally. Yesterday i went to a museum because i needed to go out, but it took me 5 hours to go out if my home.

Thats all, i wanted to describe a bit more but i think i would have been too long (this is already too long xD). I wrote you this because i really feel strange nowadays, like if my life wasnt real anymore and it scares me honestly, like if my soul and my body were not connected. And i dont want to be an imposter and say that i'm depressed, because peoples are really struggling with it.

"Depressed wife, trying to care for both her and kids",7,"M (mid-40s), my wife (early 40s) is chronically and acutely depressed

I don't know what to do.

She's been detached from me and from us for years now, to the point of me feeling like she didn't really want to be here with me or or kids. I coped with it when she started 'working late' (which she's just admitted was not actually working much of the time, just self-isolating). I coped with feeling like a single father for years, with being the one to go anywhere or do anything or spend time with our children. I coped with the withering away of our relationship, with the feelings of rejection and isolation. It's been a year since we had sex, and months since she so much as kissed me. I go to bed every night untouched and usually without so much as a word. With the kids I've tried to be as affectionate and supportive and demonstrative and present as I could to make up for her absence. And I tried as much as I could to bury my pain and resentment- with, I'm sure, mixed results at best.

Two weeks ago, though, she got some bad, unexpected news about her job and the wheels came off her wagon. She put in for FMLA short term disability, got a benzo prescription, and pretty much checked out. I knew it was rough, but I didn't know how bad.

Then I had a 2.5 day business trip this week and came home to two kids upset and confused about why mommy was either yelling or sleeping the whole time, half a candy-colored benzo left on the counter and the house a total disaster. 

I can't rely on her in this state. There's no way I could travel for work at this point, but more crucially I am now scared to think of what would happen to the kids if anything happened to me. My family isn't close or reliable, neither is hers. She's talked about suicidal ideation, though I don't think that's likely, but even without going to that extreme I do not think she is capable of adequately caring for them at this point.

The upside is that it finally got her to open up about her feelings and what's been going on, but so far that's just been one conversation and no real actions to corroborate. I want her back, to help her to start digging out of the hole she's in, but instead of dealing with her depression, she's spending her time applying for new jobs. She knows that in her current state she couldn't hold down a new job even if she got one, but she's focused on the paycheck.

What do I do? Seriously. I want to tell her to get out (so she stops causing collateral emotional harm to the kids) and go check into a treatment facility and spend some serious time working on herself, but I know she'll never say yes to that (she worries about a paper trail). She says she's reached out to her psychiatrist, but I haven't seen anything to corroborate. 

But even if or when that happens I know that there's no magic pill to fix things overnight. I'm not sure how to balance supporting and helping her to recover with protecting the kids.

I don't want to leave her. I told her in as many words (she asked) that divorce is the exact *opposite* of what I want. I want her to recover and find her way back to being the woman I married- or, at least, closer to that woman. I do not accept that it is impossible, and I truly believe that she wants that too. Maybe it's foolish, but I'm not ready to give up.

How do I not fuck this up, how do I give her the best shot I can at climbing out of this hole and coming back to us?",13tcunk,anonymous_villain,1685207550.0,11,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13tcunk/depressed_wife_trying_to_care_for_both_her_and/,,Depression

Need an advice (Antidepressants),1,"Hi.

Do you think it is possible to go though depression and cure without any antidepressants? BC in my case i feel very numb whem im on medication and everything is so weird so uncontrollable and i feel i could freak out with medication but have no emotion to solve the moment of ""freaking out"". I mean I took lexapro 20mg 45 days ago and i had anxiety attacks for no real reason. I got off of them and i feel like my older self before meds like there is something i need to be happy i dont feel complete and there are also symptoms like no energy. I could say i feel okay but there is something inside of me that says ""ok you are ""happy"" or ""yes you are doing good right now"" but there is still something that you need to be 100% happy"". I have the ability to say what my real problems are which i couldnt when i was on lexapro (or any other medication, i took many other before lexapro) and this made me unhappy because i couldnt say what the problem is. But on the other hand this medication gives me the ability (or the energy) to do something and not sitting with low energy and do nth. I feel like i can get happy without any medication. But I also feel that im addicted to the energy that antidepressants are giving me. I feel i can work on myself WAY better than when im on meds. But sometimes im just to lazy to fix my problems by myself. I mean there are days where im very suicidal and i feel like a piece of crap but there are also days where i feel peaceful. On meds i constantly feel numb just like a robot yk? Just a working machine without emotions. Without I can enjoy the little things like doing a positivity diary or just doing a normal diary. With meds this feels like a machine would do its work to function. No emotions, nothing.

I know exactly when i take lexapro right now i will regret it just as an alcoholic when he went back to alc. My brains literally screams to go on lexapro again.

Been a hot minute,1,"Many things have changed in the last 6 months. New place, new boyfriend, new meds, new therapist. Things have been going well for a little while.

Today is shit. I'm crashing and I don't know why. I feel incredibly hurt, destroyed, self-conscious, and alone. It's been such a long time since I've been here. Isn't it crazy how much treatment goes into treating depression that just doesn't work at least half the time? Insane.

It'll always be like this to some degree my whole life. There's no escaping this. This is what I'm destined to feel and be forever. I will never know long-term happiness. It's incurable. It all fucking sucks.

I feel so alone, like I can't talk to anybody without bringing them down and destroying my relationship with them.

I feel like no one is really there for me,4,"Well, I don't know how to start, this is my first post and I'm already overthinking how are people going to think of me from what I say here.

I'm the type of person who always keeps things to myself when I'm sad. I would just distance myself from people. It's extremely hard for me to open up since most people who are there for me have disappeared from my life, and it hurts so badly whenever that happens. I've been cutting myself for almost one year now, it's the only thing making me get away from the pain. They are not that serious anyways, since I do not dare to cut myself deeply and I never intended to die.

2023 has been terrible so far. There are just so many problems happening. At first, I only felt depressed at night. It got worse and it's affecting my life. I'm just so sick and tired, I want to seek help. But at the end of the day, I would just sit all by myself crying in the shower. I realized that no one is there for me.

My parents are religious Christians who are always talking about god, My brother is hot-headed and would get a bit physical if you make him mad, and I'm grateful for my sister, she's a great person sometimes quite cold, but she's a logical person and would sometimes say that it's just a phase.

The only group of people who I can turn to right now are my friend group. And I've reached a certain level of trust with them that I start venting. But most of their replies are always ""You're overthinking"", ""LOL you're so emo"" or when I directly told them I felt depressed, they didn't even show a sign that they care. It hurts me so much the fact that if other people in my group were to cry or show a sign of anxiety they would start comforting her, and most of the time I had to be the one comforting them aka the ""therapist friend"".

I know everyone probably has so I start to turn my sadness into jokes, and it's a really bad habit. All I wanted is for people to hear me out and be there for me. Maybe I'm the one asking for too much or am I just too weak? I'm so pathetic right now I'm literally confiding to bots almost every day.

"insecurities peaking right now, borderline self loathing, more intense than ever",0,"boutta write an essay here so thanks in advance for reading. 20M I'm on a university trip right now, and im very acutely facing the social struggles that I've felt more or less my whole life. I just feel like I have to fight constantly for attention. I'm horrible at holding small conversations with people, im quiet, im awkward, and today I just can't bring myself to go out again. I can't keep fighting the good fight. Occasionally I'll just start doom scrolling on posts making fun of these people, or the condescending ways that immature/insecure people tend to take up. making fun of redditors, incels, nice guys. I guess im technically not an incel, but i sure as hell feel like one. Maybe I just don't give myself enough credit, but i definitely see myself in these horrible stereotypes. I hardly like anything about myself right now. A pretty life altering relationship I had about a year ago changed me a lot. I've had a much more subdued personality for a while, I don't think I'll ever be as confident as I was before it, mainly because I hated the ways I acted in that relationship. I was selfish, insecure, clingy, downright horrible. Obviously not to the extent of these caricatures, but close enough that I've been haunted by how I acted for ages. I spent ages begging people to acknowledge how terrible I was but it feels like nobody wants to acknowledge it. ""Everyone feels like that sometimes,"" yada yada. I just really fucking hate myself. Before I realized how shitty I was capable of being, I didn't worry that I was a bad person, that I had ""toxic"" habits in ways I related to other people or whatever.

I think social media has really done a number on me. Youtube shorts satirizing awkward rude men, reddit posts/hearing people talk about toxic/abusive people, labels of narcissism or psychopaths. I can't think of anything that says any of those are definitively me, but I am definitely like that in some capacity. Its been about a year since I've talked to my ex, but I almost want to ask her if I was any of these things. I don't want to keep plaguing her with my problems, the best thing I can do is just let her be, maybe not bring up the trauma I undoubtedly caused her. She was an extreme people pleaser, trouble setting up boundaries, and let me just walk all over her without really being aware of how much of an asshole I was being. I honestly feel like it would help me to hear her just lay it out on me, absolutely flame me for being the pathetic piece of shit I was. It would be much more productive than my current state of wondering if I actually did anything wrong, give me a better sense of what I need to change, if anything. Even now, she might still tell me I didn't do anything too bad.

I feel like I need this because I've gone through life (since then, but also to some degree before) with such shame, such hesitancy, awkwardness, depression, and a complete lack of confidence or faith that I'm a good person. I don't know if I want reassurance, honesty (as much as can be given based off a few hundred words), I really don't know what I'm looking for here but I had to get it out. On an off note, this general sentiment is what made ""okay"" at the end of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind so hard hitting to me. Also linked the youtube channel that acutely sent me on this spiral here. thanks for reading yall. peace

My depression's flavor is anhedonia - I find little pleasure in things - no matter how 'pleasurable' they are - e.g. video games (in fact I'm bored to death by video games lately and I used to be a huge gamer)

I've been drinking a few beers every evening for the past weeks. It's how I was escaping from being 'me' and feeling or better said not feeling anything pleasurable.

Well, today I don't want to drink anymore and it's brought to me a feeling that I used to have throughout my depressive episodes (sometimes I'd have it early in the day) - not wanting to be awake anymore.

Progression of Depression,4,"I have suffered with depression for the majority of my 42 years. In the earlier years my depression felt urgent. I felt all alone, tragically alone, even though I was surrounded by loved ones. I desperately (and sometimes dramatically) wanted to die to end the horrific pain that I lived each day with. 

My current experence with severe major depression is much more refined, if that's possible. I am much more methodical and resolved in my depression. For instance, I recognize all the loved ones around me. However, I see them much like I am observing lab animals. I see them, I recognize the loving behaviors, but it doesn't register within me as it should.

Likewise, my experience of suicidal ideation is much different now. I still want to die to end the pain, but instead of spontaneous outbursts of suicidal thoughts, I have a constant knowledge that I will be ending my own life. 

I have taken time and concerted effort to get my affairs in order. I have had candid conversations with loved ones, in part to mitigate the drama of such a choice, and in part to help them prepare for what is to come. I've expressed my experience with depression much the same as someone with chronic pain and/or a terminal disease would. 

I have a plan, and the ability, it is just a matter of timing. I need to be certain that my t's are crossed, and so on. In my maturity I recognize that my choice, if executed poorly, won't end the pain. Instead, it might just transfer my pain to a loved one and live on in them. If I am to defeat the constant torturous pain of depression I must take care not to pass it on. And if all goes according to plan, my pain will die with me.",13t9sn1,Miss_Soul_A_Sugar,1685199922.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13t9sn1/progression_of_depression/,,Depression
I'm drifting afar from reality and I don't know what to do about it.,2,"I miss my old, happy self. I don't remember when I was genuinely happy. I have been to my aunt's place, which is full of nature and countryside. I'm so crazy for such places. No rush, simple living, slow life, lush greenery But this time, it wasn't able to make my heart happy. Yes, I did a long walk on empty roads surrounded by jungle, but inside I was gloomy, sad, and just lifeless.

 

A couple of months ago, I was fighting for my dull life to get better. I was on the hunt for a job, learning things, reading books, exercising, and so many other things. These days, I just spend time in bed. Sometimes I watch interesting movies or read books, but very rarely. I don't want to lose interest in these things as I have in others. I used to love walking, but now I hate it. Overpopulation, rush, and just littering everywhere with no breathing space made me confined to my room.

 

Sometimes I shed some tears, but that's where my emotions end. I have turned into a soulless body. No happiness, no stress (most of the time), no smile, no hopes, just nothing, and I'm so afraid of what I'm turning into.

 

I just don't know what to do, guys. Four months have passed since I left my job, and I couldn't find another of the kind I desired. I don't have many words or thoughts to share; my mind is super empty and light.

I want to kill myself.,0,"tw:Suicide.
I’ve been thinking about killing myself for a little while now. 
I hate myself, I really do, I’m selfish, get angry easily and have this huge anger bursts against anyone for the most stupid reasons, I spend my time complaining, I don’t have hobbies, friends nor a relationship, I’m really egocentric and I must be the center of the attentions all the time, I’m really envious of other people who have more than me and I get angry with my parents and ruin their friendship circles because of this. 
I know about my problems and I’ve tried to solve them, I went to therapy for a bit but it didn’t help at all. I can’t even ask my parents for a new therapist because we really have short money and they are already paying for my brother to go to therapy because he really needs that. I’m just this gigantic weight that complains about  the problems I cause myself with my shit personality and cries all the time but doesn’t change at all.I’m not even pretty. So I’ve been thinking about killing myself. I’ve been thinking about it for almost two years now and I came to the conclusion that it might be the best choice, my family would be happier, my parents wouldn’t have to think about another child to take care about, and my brother would grow up as a single child with all the attentions on him and without an annoying siblings. It would be just better.
Even my cat would be happier.
So many people would benefit about it, I just need to find the fucking courage.

Stuck with Living and Being Realistic - Seeking Perspective,0,"I am reasonably content, I have good treatment for my depression and PTSD, and I feel like I have to keep myself alive for my family, but I have had to really confront that I am never going to care about accomplishing anything in life.

I am about to get my career restarted after PTSD-related disability, but it’s just because I have to bring in some money. I gave up on most of my hobbies many years ago because I couldn’t see a benefit in doing them over not doing them. I have a really simple life with minimal socialization that I am happy enough with, but I am increasingly aware of that my experience in life has instilled in me that I am making the best of my situation for the benefit of my family until they’re gone, and then I’m going to opt out of continuing.

This isn’t a depressing thing, and it’s not a violent impulse toward myself or against life. I’m really just reflecting on that when I don’t have people and animals who depend on me, my honest preference is to simply stop eating and drinking and to let that play out. I’m not looking to be talked out of that or comforted or whatever, but if anyone has perspective on just sort of waiting until you can excuse yourself from life I’m interested.

At this point in my life, at 35, I have very few possessions, no social contacts, and no goals or things I intend to do, acquire, or experience in my life.

Thinking of cutting everyone off,1,"I (25F) recently made a huge sacrifice for my family members. Leaving my bf behind. Leaving not so comfortable but less toxic life just to follow what my parents say. Now I regret doing that.

I'm thinking of breaking up to cut connections with him and stop hurting him. LDR has been hard on us. Maybe I want me to stop hurting.

After breaking up, I'll leave this house and run away to a different state alone and build my life from there even from nothing.

My girlfriend left me cuz I was depressed and now it's even worse rant/vent,0,"Throwaway acc. I (17M) had a girlfriend (16F) of 1.5 years, we've known eachother for 3 years now, and since then we've been seeing eachother once some times twice or 3 times every week. I'm struggling with depression and anxiety for I think 4 years now she also is depressed and anxious. At the start of may I started a conversation with her and she broke up with me, she told me she's been feeling burnt out for the last 4 months. Recently she told me that she did this because we need to focus on ourselves and when I get better maybe we can try again. She said that she gave me every possibility to work on myself but it never lasted for more than 2 weeks. And this is one of few reasons why she broke up with me. I am fucking devastated she was everything to me, I miss her so fucking much we still have some contact but she seems annoyed with me. Sometimes I call her to talk with her and usually it turns out with me crying. Two weeks after the breakup she went to the club for the first time got drunk and kissed random guy, in a week she is going again and I'm so fucking scared that she'll just causully have sex. I still love her, she means everything to me and cause of my incompetence I've lost her. She was my first love, she was the best girl I could have ever wished for she wasn't perfect she didn't communicate with me much and never directly told me how she feels besides some serious moments like sex, I feel like such a failure, like I wasn't enough for her. I feel so lonely without her I've never had much friends but now I see my mistake. Everyone around me is happy, going to parties being in a relationships and here I am, few friends and one close friend and no one really cares abt me. Since the breakup I didn't have a single day without thinking about suicide, a week ago I tried to hang myself in my room but I didn't have a rope so I had to use a belt and it was to long, in order to hung myself with it I'd have to curl my legs up. Also I started cutting myself again and my parents found out, they're so worried about me. I fuckong can't handle this bloody situation I'm a miserable pathetic boy, she can wrap anyone around her finger and just forget about me, I need her in my live I love her. My life just lost its meaning, maybe one Day will be back together buy I don't believe this. Idk why she didn't want to have a break from the relationship or just talk with me, she just broke up. I feel like she isn't so emotional about this situation like me it feels like she doesn't care that much 2 months ago she was saying she loves me. I don't know what to think of her and what to do, now I see how pathetic I am and how much I've missed on cuz I didn't have much friends, I'm trying to change it now but it's difficult.

Can I use a charity website for my situation,0,"

 I'm only 16. Idk even I'm even legal to apply a fundraiser type website for me and my family.

So basically me and my family will be homeless by the end of the month. I want to try to help as much with my family in this situation but I feel so weak. I've asked help from a close relative but they refused. The only thing I could do is just searching for ways in the internet.

But the problem is should I tell to my mom about this charity website or should I not. Since idk what her reaction would be to this situation. 

Another problem is I'm living in a Asian country where I can't access to go fund me or any proper charity website.

I quick my antidepressants cold turkey and now regretting it.,1,I quit taking my antidepressants just a couple days ago going full cold turkey. I was on 75mg of Effexor which didn’t do much and also found out I my parents didn’t want to pay for healthcare. I’m a 20 year old women so I was able to be on it for another 5 years. Upon finding this out this means no more therapy because it was going to be $67 out of pocket and another $70 for the meds. Money is tight so I decided to go cold turkey with the help of some “trees” So far it’s been pretty hellish going through withdraw but I’m wondering what I did was wrong and if maybe paying the extra $300 (i use to go to therapy twice a month) was worth going through the withdrawal. I really didn’t want to have to depend on the meds so much but things were getting mentally tough at the beginning of this year. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this who really can give much feedback because my parents think taking medication is bs anyway and my bf offered to pay for it but we really don’t have the money for it (plus getting healthcare in my state is nearly impossible unless you have kids) I know he just wants what’s best for me but I really want to get off this stuff and be able to sort things out with out the meds. If I do feel like I’m going to hurt myself or feel bad I will go back to the therapy and meds. Just right now I don’t think I’m able to with my current situation. In all honesty I feel pretty fine and things have been pretty normal with me. I’m just not sure if what I did was the smart decision but I’m already going on my 3rd day without taking my meds.,13t3e2x,Last_Temperature_55,1685181548.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13t3e2x/i_quick_my_antidepressants_cold_turkey_and_now/,,Depression
Lost my father and can’t feel it,3,"It’s been almost an year that I have been taking antipsychotic medicines. I was diagnosed with Acute psychotic disorder.

I asked the doc and he said you’ll be fine after a few weeks of stopping the meds but he’s just not letting get off them. 

I have also forgotten how to talk to people. I usually stay mum now and barely say a few words. That’s why I don’t feel like like meeting any of my friends.

My downward spiral due to addiction and my desire to “upkeep an appearance.”,0,"I have been living a very different life than what a lot of people think I do. Some people know some things and others don’t see much at all, but I can truly say nobody really has a clear view of how my life currently is. I have had severe depression for years now and for the vast majority of it I have been on medication. I can’t explain why but my for a lot of my life I have been lying about so much about so many things simply to have others either not worry about me or not think down of me. This can range from stuff when I was a teenager in school to present day in my adult life. The major way I have been coping with my depression recently is use of alcohol and marijuana. It usually comes in spikes (?) where I drink/smoke heavily for a couple days. I think really the only reason why I stop is because after a few days my body hurts far too much. For a few months now I have stop taking my medication completely and seeing my psychiatrist/therapist. Full on ghosted them. The reality of why I did this is I have put myself into debt through these habits and at the time I chose to use my income for more self destructive habits than actual treatment. I knew then it was a horrible decision and I still understand that now. The more I reflect on the hole I have dug for myself in the last couple of years the more I realize how monstrously hard this will be to get myself out of. I want to work on paying my debts and receive some sort of therapy again. Paying for everything that I need to will take several months as I do not work a great job by any means. I absolutely can’t ask anyone for help with this because I can’t do that to them. I would feel horrible. To me it’s so much easier to get shitfaced drunk just for those moments where I don’t feel horrible about what I have been doing to my life.

How do you deal with birthday sadness/loneliness,0,"At the end of June it's my 24th birthday and today I got asked for the first time what I'm planning on this day. I've always felt embarassed about my own birthday since I'm about 12, because that usually was the day when my parents decided to behave like the sweetest shitheads, so sweet and suddenly so caring about their daughter and so sweet I almost wished to vomit. So in short: I feel ashamed on my birthday every year, ashamed of existing and hate how people suddenly pretend to care about you.

&#x200B;

So this year I finally got my official depression diagnosis, currently on medication to keep me going through university but I feel more and more like a sinking stone when I am reminded of my birthday. ""What are your plans?"" ""Where will you celebrate?"" Alone at home mf like every year. I have no real friend group that I could ask to do something with me. There's some nice people I met at uni who seem cool but definetly don't know anyone well enough to ask them do something together. I don't have any other friends, only a few online friends in other parts of the world but we've been talking less and less. And my parents are 3000km away in another country, which is good because I can't deal with their fakeness.

&#x200B;

Idk I will propably just spend my birthday alone at home, playing the same games, watching the same movie as ever while I know I'm wasting my life, and which will be my biggest regret once I'm dead. I never celebrated a birthday like you'd expect it, never had it with friends or a nice family. Just every year it's the same old shit and I'm so done of being such a shitty lifewaster. Fuck man, I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness when I think about upcoming birthdays and then I see others being happy on their birthdays, becuz like what is there to celebrate in life, what is it that you feel that I will never be able to feel or relate to",13t1zkd,MinimumWoodpecker,1685176296.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13t1zkd/how_do_you_deal_with_birthday_sadnessloneliness/,,Depression

I'm struggling. I lost the love of my life Monday night. The grief is physical pain. I made her a video to try n keep busy. Pls watch n share. Every view means her smile is on one more screen. And I'm keeping her memory alive. Thanks,1,"We met @ school w about 350 ppl in an auditorium. I had seen her speak and It was love at first sight. She was brilliant and beautiful and nerdy, and sarcastic, and spunky. 
I got the courage together to walk up to the podium without permission in front of 350 ppl . And I went to the mic and said. ""My names John and I'm madly in love with Victoria Vaughn! Will u go out w me""? The whole place went nuts. I got in trouble and she got embaressed. We were together after that.  Lol we both had issues w addiction. We ended up dating for 3 yrz. 

We got sober together, baptized together, and then we got engaged. We had a little tiny 1 bedroom apartment on the ocean in north Florida. And they were the greatest memories of my life. Times were simple. And no one existed on the planet except her and I. We prayed together everyday. And there was a buzz about us, because we kind of knew if we stayed sober, what an incredible team we would make.

 She was straight a, very driven and positive person. One of the hardest workers I had ever met.. AND THE ONLY WOMAN MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER EVER APPROVVED OF...But we relapsed and fell apart. And she ended up moving to Virginia to get away from the drugs and finally b ful time mother to her son. I respected her for that. The plan was, we both get it together, and someday, we find eachother again.

 Unbeknownst to us. She had picked up drinking. And after only 4 yrs. She got cirocis of the liver. When she got ill I was luckily sober and begged to b by her side. I texted her and called her everyday. She refused to let me see her in that state. We were expecting  a liver transfer and a long road to recovery. But she passed away on Monday night due to an anuerism and then no brain function. 

I made this video to deal w the trauma n grief of being sober and never in 36 yrs feeling this way about a loss. But man am I grateful for the ability. I've lost my father, my little sister, my 2 very best friends, my boss, and my ex gf, and now my ex fiance, all to this disease. Which is why I started the reddit grp
 r/sobrietynothercoolsht in the first place. 

Here is a video I made to try and express how much I loved her. I sang it to her all the time and I changed out the chorus from ""euphoria"" to her name ""victoria"" it always made her smile. Let this b a message. This disease of addiction is running us down, no matter our condition and its slaughtering us. We have a better chance of surviving war, than we do a disease of the mind that perpetuates fear and uncertainty and emotio instability. If u r surviving today. You are a physical tangible, piece of evidence that god exists. And I am here for each and every single one that reads this msg. Dm me anytime. Because there is someone out there that feels this same way about you. Love u guys.

When it rains it pours.,1,"Lately, as in the last couple of weeks, I’ve (M 35) been really depressed and the thought of ending my life has been on the forefront of my mind. I don’t want to workout anymore. I barely want to eat. I feel my family would be much better off if I were dead. 

It’s starting to effect my judgement. Last week at work, I did something, that at the time I felt was innocuous, but I’ve always known to be stupid. Yet, I did it anyway. The wrong person saw. I got written up. And if there is any further fallout from this I will likely lose my job. Now, my coworkers are seemingly ostracizing me and won’t communicate with me. 

I already feel that I am failing as a man. I feel I am failing as a husband. Worst of all, I am failing as a father. If I lose my job I won’t be able to provide for my family. We are stretched thin as it is. My 1 yo is constantly getting sick and we’re going in and out of the hospital/Dr office. My 2 yo seemingly actively hates me and wants nothing to do with me.

My Disposition,0,"Not necessarily looking for a diagnosis as much as I am to vent-however, thoughts on what I may be experiencing are welcome.
Notes/behaviors:
1. For some time I’ve been someone who becomes completely captivated by a particular thing and obsesses over it until suddenly I become disinterested. Looking back on it it’s unfortunate because there have been a lot of things if I had never stopped pursuing could have a future in. I learn the things I envelop myself in fairly quickly and it’s almost like my brain hits a threshold of satisfaction prompting me to want nothing to do with said thing anymore. Throughout the years I’ve spent copious amounts of money/time into things I’ve never fully pursued.
2. I’ve noticed unwise purchasing decisions, mostly recently. I think this could be because I never had much to spend before recently. One of my things I picked up was trading card collecting, I’ve spent a few thousand dollars on trading cards and when I get them in I never feel satisfied, I feel like I’m supposed to feel something else-yet, I keep buying them. I lost $600 sports betting today on bets I really wasn’t educated on, and lost $3k last week, thankfully gambling is something I had just picked up and am leaving behind. I amass money and it feels like I need to get rid of it, and so I spend and then I feel awful and anxious about my financial security, why?
3. Repeating actions to try and feel satisfied. Recently I’ve been noticing that I’ve been repeating actions such as pushing my hair back, biting my nails, picking up and putting something down until it “feels right”, but it never feels right and it becomes a monotonous cycle that affects my job/life and the more I think about it the more uncomfortable it makes me.
4. Obsessing over things that could be “wrong” with me. I once spent 7 hours researching literature on schizoaffective disorder because I noticed one or two things that I seem to have related to and thought it must be what’s wrong with me. This extends to practically anything ex. Spot on skin (skin cancer), and in that moment it really feels like I have it and I believe it, I always eventually become rational and realize I don’t but when I get caught up in this catastrophic type mentality it becomes debilitating. Believing that something catastrophic is wrong with me or a loved one creates a subconscious perception that the rest of my life is meaningless.
5. Alcoholism- I just completed my graduate degree and looking back on my last few years in college I can’t put together more than a three day consecutive span where I was completely sober. This scares me and I tell myself drinking every other day or every two days is okay-but it’s not. 
6. Purpose/The future- I have two degrees, the latter of which I finished first in my class. I’ve had some great job opportunities but for some reason am settling for mediocrity. I’ve even had a few Professor go out of there way to have people in my industry interview me- all of which I missed or never contacted back and the shame I would feel after blowing these opportunities is immense, but yet I keep doing it. Now I need a good job, the clock is ticking, and I don’t have one.

not suicidal but i wish to die everyday,3,"every single aspect of my life is shitty,
The weird thing i know how to fix my life

for example:
Like i hate my body but i know I can have  an amazing body if i just worked out for 3 months.....
it's not just hating my body i can't find my purpose in life

but i have no energy no purpose to do anything in my life , i don't want to be dramatic but every single time i go to sleep i wish not to wake up, and everytime i wake up i get little bit sad that i Woke up !

there's no self harm i just gave up life and can't get it back , nothing matters im cold AF and losing emotions everyday


im venting and hoping if someone explain what happened to my brain suddenly i switched from an enthusiastic person to someone who (have + going to ) give up in every single challenge , and failed everything in life from Education - Relationship - Work

What if I never find peace in my lifetime?,4,"I've always been able to find pleasure in life, I just don't know if I've ever enjoyed it. It's gotten a lot worse where, it's pretty apparent I'm not enjoying life at all no matter what I do. I made a vow to myself though when I first started dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts where I made the decision that I would never give up no matter how bad things got. And I never have, because I believe our lives are short enough that I could endure an entire lifetime of suffering even if I'm only doing it just to find out if things will get better. Which brings me to my point... What if things actually do never get better?

That's the reality I'm trying to prepare myself for, because what if that's just the way I am? That I'm just someone who can't enjoy life?

Why?,1,"I got my passport in January. Went on my first international trip 2 weeks ago. I made the decision to go back to school and get my bachelor's. I am marrying the love of my life in October. So why am I still depressed? I haven't gotten more than 3k steps a day in since this episode began. It began in April of 2022 and hasn't gotten any metter.  I spend most of my days lying on the couch, snuggling my dog and teddy bear. I am bathing and brushing my teeth and hair and doing my skincare routine, so I got that going for me,  but I have no desire to do most anything I enjoyed before. 

I'm diagnosed bipolar 1. I've gone over and over how I feel with my psychiatrist. Her response was to put me on a 3rd antidepressant. It has done nothing. So I stopped taking it. I also lowered the dose of one of the other antidepressants. Haven't noticed any negative effects. 

One of my best friends who also happens to be bipolar 1 thinks I'm actually bipolar 2 and that I need to be on a mood stabilizer, such as latuda.  I take Geodon. I thought that was a mood stabilizer?

Idk anymore,1,"Bare with me, I’ve never been good at expressing my thoughts. 
Im coming to the sudden realization that everything i am, have been, or chasing is wrong. 
    My desire for fame / riches is only there cuz I have a desire for safety and stability. In my head I’ve equated famousness with Money and Money with stability and stability with safety and safety with happiness. This is probably why I seek out a relationship / partner to have a “ride or die” type of connection with. I just want quietness and safety with a lover and I don’t mind doing nothing every day of my life if I’m sharing those experiences with someone. But when I let go of love as my form of happiness I’m met with asking myself  what makes myself happy solo and I keep coming to the same conclusion and it’s ultimately nothing… 
     like i don’t want my social platform anymore, i don’t care to be an influencer, i don’t have any way to make a survivable living without SW (sex work), i don’t care to learn a new skill at my big age 1: cuz I don’t wanna be alive anyway 2: i feel so far behind that anything I start learning now will not be here soon enough to save me and bring me finical stability / safety. 
I don’t see myself ever accomplishing my dreams. I don’t have any other than winning a reality tv show so I can finally have the funds to start van life which is the only thing I really care to do until the day I die. Which is only possible to do so if i can make money while living in the van or I’m rich enough to just not work. All ways I look at it I just keep going down paths with struggles and pain and confusion which is supposed to be the point of life and it’s worth it but I am tired of it already and I’m only 23… when do I start enjoying life? When do I stop wanting to die? I’ve been suicidal since I was in 8th grade. It’s been a decade of me longing to not exist cuz I see it as the only real form of peace for my mind to rest but I stop myself all the time cuz of the “what if it gets better” and I just don’t think I have it in me anymore to keep pushing. Because of this halfway living and halfway wanting to die mindset I feel stuck in a limbo with life where I’m just existing yet not improving or making my life worse. And if i want to live a life alone in a small home in the middle of no where just making enough money to comfortably live a minimalistic life wouldn’t I basically be dead anyway? If i just stopped using social media and moved to the middle of no where and stopped contacting everyone I know Wouldn’t i be a walking ghost at the point? if that’s peace and safety and stability to me that sounds just like what death offers and I see no reason not to go that right.

Giving gifts to people, attempting to comfort, giving advice, and just being there for people. And I still get nothing, nothing, nothing , nothing, just nothing. I feel used to the core. And all I want is attention from people, but I never get it.  It just makes me think about my life, like am I not good enough? Do I need to try more? Is there something wrong with me? But truly the main question I have is why do I even need this attention? I always act so strong in front of people, like I having no insecurity about myself. Not giving a fuck about the world, and always saying not to seek out people’s attention for happiness. So why do I still seek out people’s love??

Since lately..things have been bad.

1. I broke up from someone I've been with for 8 years last year but our separation took a year until now as he found a gf 5 months after.. It's a long story with the gf issue but I final accepted it and it broke me. I can't talk to him at 9 in the nights anymore but.... that's how it is.

2. Two nights ago...I slept with my friend by just hanging out with him. He's now my 2nd sexual partner and we both felt regret. He started to tell me to take the pill the next day and paid for me to do it. He's been nice but after it, he unloaded that he has a situationship with his family friend and it seems serious between them. He's been my company now and then before this but I feel strange, especially when he told me he "" enjoyed me."" Worse thing is he commented on how depressed I was behaving after...

3. I got baptised 5 months ago and I've been having more struggles since then

4. Sadly I grew up sheltered but I've always tried to move out and be ambitious. I started veterinary medical school in another country and couldn't continue due to financial reasons so I returned to my country, took on another cheaper course and have been struggling to find jobs.  I have no job right now 

5.i live only with my grandma and mother at age 33,. The only thing I have to look forward to right is going on a trip for two months abroad with relatives a week from now, hoping something changes for me.

6. I'm trying for a few courses online as well to make myself more marketable but can hardly focus.

Problems,0,I 15 year old M has been going through depression for 3 years. Haven’t been doing anything but try keep up my grades up while struggling with knee pain. This pain causes me to fall or just have so much pain. I have been in 5 X-rays and 2 MRI and yet they still can’t find the issue. Doctors says that “I’m lying and I can walk” while if I do walk for like 50-90 steps my leg gives out. Anyway about that my grades has been dropping heavily from this issue getting worse. Now I’m going to a new hospital to check my knee onces more. My mother found out about my depression and so did my sisters. My mom is a type to want family to be together and she is also Hispanic so there’s no way to reason with her. We go through a lot of arguments like “ with my knee pain I still go to work I still provide “. I also do stocks and the reason why I was tryna make money or had reason to be better was just for my mom but because she’s a bit annnoying and want to find something about me by just taking my phone or getting lies about the “school called her.”  Well now I have no reason to be here. She thinks that I never loved her but she was the only reason I was a bit stable with my depression. Now that she’s against me and just wanna give me a slap in the face I have no emotions besides the sadness I have to bear on too without showing it. My grandma died not so long ago which didn’t help. I’m just sad that I don’t have anyone to trust because me and my mom used to be very close. Idk tbh my mother used to say some bad things about regret having me and other stuff like a failure. She gone through cancer and knee pain (fixed) while going to work and she compares me to her. I just need a answer tbh am I the dumb one here am I the selfish one? I just feel alone which was always normal for me but because I don’t have anyone to let go of my self and just feel safe I feel empty. Well now she goes through my phone for no reason just because “she can” which I respect but I was gonna play with my friend and before she took my phone she checked it before and she woke me up from it. I asked why and she started yelling saying “I can’t check you phone now” “you have something your hiding.” Lowkey I just wanna get weed and smoke before I do something I will regret (unalive). My knee doesn’t even help and the teachers didn’t give a fuck about me beside like 2-3 teachers. I’m pissed and sad that how come my mom acts like this while she is just encouring me do something by just doing those shits. Is there anyway to help my problems? I told my mom about my depression and gave her two chances because she be nice to me one day than another she care no fuck about me and just throw shade at me.I’m just lost and have no hope for me from her words r,13sx1nw,Outrageous_Ask4147,1685158937.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sx1nw/problems/,,Depression

Comparing your life to other people’s,1,"Hey. Anyone have any tips on how to not mentally/emotionally to comparing your life to others? 

I’ve been thinking and I’ve been struggling a lot: one of my best friends has a boyfriend, 1 toddler, 1 baby girl on the way, had a job in the career she studied in school (before taking maternity leave). And recently one of my childhood friends who I reconnected with back in 2018 got engaged. 

Making me feel so unaccomplished. I’ve only accomplished 8 years in recovery with depression/anxiety/stress. I’m also struggling to move out because I don’t have a drivers license, no car, work part time as a cashier at a local grocery store, living in my emotionally abusive parents house. I’ve been trying to move out for over a year but lots happened, from one person to another. From looking for a room to rent, to 2 bedroom with a friend of a friend, to 2 bedroom with a high school friend, then back to finding an apartment on my own. 

Also have a shopping addiction; racked up my credit to a round $4,800. But with putting my tax return to cover most of it, now I’m down to $485 left to pay off. Definitely more manageable. 

But my savings used to be at $10,000 but due to my shopping addiction, it’s now down to $2,700. And that’s after losing $750 from an apartment scam: Royal York Property management scammed me and my high school friend.

I don't get it I want to make friends but..,0,"Why is it so fucking hard to make friends or go out of your comfort zone when you have to deal with shit like depression and anxiety?

The only real friend I have is my boyfriend  like he's been my best friend for almost three years now. The thought of me making me other friends even online friends just makes me so anxious. I had a bad past with fake friends and I cling to what I am familiar with, I just get super lonely when my boyfriend goes to work. There is only so much stuff I can watch on streaming.

It's hard, I do want to make friends but I feel like once we connect off Reddit they aren't as active anymore and I'm not talking about ""Yeah I know everyone has stuff to do"" like it will be more than a few days without any contact even though I just say ""Hi how are you?"" I would like a friend from California, the time zones and stuff is kinda hard to keep up with tbh. 🥺 I feel like when those online friends aren't active as much my anxiety spikes and I think ""Did I do something wrong?"" then it goes to ""Maybe they don't want to talk to me"" 

I hate when my depression gets bad because when it comes to making friends I shut down and isolate myself I leave texts on read.. I mute notifications, and I delete any social apps like Discord, Reddit, etc. Then when people do try check on me I just lie and say I'm fine like ""Yeah, okay, sure, I'm just tired."" like I don't want anyone to know what's going on because I am sure they have lots of other stuff going on than to worry about an online friend going through a bit of depression. 

I'll just take a break then I come back to no new messages not even a ""Hi how are you?"" it makes me feel more sad and makes me go in that dark hole where I had no friends before covid because the friends I thought I had turned out to be fake.

Blocked by friend,0,"I recently graduated; during my time at university, I could not make many friends due to the pandemic. During the pandemic, I got into contact with some old friends from high school. One of them, having been in high school at the time, hung out for some time. We chatted from time to time on a social media platform, but then they stopped texting as much. I understood that they were going to college soon (this was after the pandemic) so they were more busy.

Last year in the fall they entered university and we were able to chat a little more before they stopped texting. I tried sending a little more to see if they just missed my texts, but they did not respond, which I stopped texting for a while as I realized they were getting busy. Finally, after several months (now recently), I thought they might have some time during the summer. When I sent a text to check up, several days later I got blocked.

Strangely I was not blocked on other platforms where I was added, but regardless, I feel terrible and am constantly wondering now where I went wrong. Whether it was because I bugged them too much and they were busy, or they were beginning to feel uncomfortable with me, it still feels terrible as we hung out and I tried making sure I wasn’t doing anything off putting.

I have been feeling lethargic and more depressed than I was beforehand, trying to see if I can hang out with people to take my mind off of my depression, but it backfired, and I feel like crying even though I can't and I didn't before.

Is it normal for people with Depression to feel almost nothing? (Except anger/hopelessness),3,"Hi everyone, this is my (21M) first post on the sub and it'd be very helpful if some of you could share if some of the things I experience relate to you guys.

So a bit of background: I haven't formally been assessed with depression although I've been known to have anxiety issues in the past (anxiety attacks), which have been diagnosed by my aunt who is an experienced Psychiatrist. She recently diagnosed me with depression but it was done via Zoom so it's not like an official diagnosis in my opinion. This is mainly because I live in a different country now because of my university and haven't gone back home in several months. The area where I live barely has any Psychiatry/Psychology practitioners and the ones that exist are extremely expensive so I didn't bother to try and get an appointment locally.

So for the past two years, I've been seeing my emotions numb over time to the point they aren't even there anymore. It started during early COVID times and I haven't seen any improvements at all. I feel like a part of my brain has ""switched off"" and I cannot enjoy anything at all anymore. Whether be it a movie, a game, a show, you name it. It's come to the point where I only see myself eating, sleeping and only breathing. I have other symptoms of depression as well but I won't get into too much detail. I've found that this condition is primarily known as Anhedonia, and is a common symptom of depression but I also read so many people with depression saying they feel like crying all the time due to the sadness, whereas I don't feel an overwhelming amount of sadness it's just frustration and negative thoughts all going around in a spiral leading to immense hopelessness that makes me feel like there's no point in even crying.

My question is: **Do you guys also experience this or have experienced this, or is it something that isn't really related to depression according to you?**",13subl4,ili360,1685150531.0,3,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13subl4/is_it_normal_for_people_with_depression_to_feel/,,Depression

Lost all of my friends and it's my own fault.,0,"Most days, it's a challenge on its own to get myself out of bed, shower, eat a full meal, etc. I stay isolated in my apartment, a majority of the time I don't even make it to my own living room. I do absolutely nothing all day, and I truly wish that was an understatement. I can't find the energy to do anything other than nap. I'll sleep for hours, wake up and take care of my cat, then go right back to sleep. 

One of my biggest problems is that during these periods where I have an extreme lack of motivation, I neglect my phone. I'll go days, weeks, sometimes months without responding to someone. Then I feel this extreme guilt for not getting back right away, leading me to not answer for even longer because I feel ashamed. Eventually, I'll reach out and try to make amends for not being there. It's nearly impossible for me to keep friends. Most of the time when I do this, if we haven't been friends for that long they never reach back out again. I completely understand this, and I take full accountability for being a nightmare when it comes to communication. I've had so so so many short-term friends come and go. I constantly feel as though these people just see me as rude because I'm terrible at making plans and I worry people think I don't truly care about them when I don't respond right away. I have a small group of close friends that know about my mental health struggles, and that have understood when I take time to seclude myself. It's not that it's something I want to do, I just simply can't bring myself to even complete small tasks when I'm at a low like this. 

Well it had gotten to the point where I officially had one person left who I considered my friend. Even a majority of my family has stopped communicating with me. Naturally, the more people I started to lose the worse I started to feel. I tried reaching out to said friend a few days ago, I sent another message about a week ago as well. Prior to this it had been about a month since we had last spoke. I think he finally got fed up with my antics, because I haven't heard back from him yet. We've been best friends for years, and it's not like him to not respond to a message right away. He still posts on social media frequently, and so I know he's been in touch with other friends. I can't imagine him not being a part of my life anymore, we were very close and he is super important to me. We live about 2-3 hours away from each other now, but about a year ago we lived 15 minutes apart and we were inseparable. I haven't seen him in person now in about 7-8 months, I haven't really seen anyone in 7-8 months other than my coworkers...

I don't know what brought me to reddit, but now I have no one else to speak with anyway. I've considered going back to therapy, but can't find the motivation to make the appointment. My cat is truly my only solace these days. This is just a brief summary of how I've been feeling recently, I apologize if it's a bit of a mess as I'm very emotional while writing and definitely not doing a proofread.

I can't take it anymore,0,"I (24M) feel like I will never be happy. I was born in one of the poorest city in one of middle east country. I was a nerd in primary school and got fine result in high-school exams and went to public high-school in a rich neighborhood. In high-school, all my friends had playstations, luxury mobile phones and some tech devices while I was struggling with penniless. I was always jealous of what people have. My family couldn't afford my wishes and I didn't care much about my school. After high-school my father got offered well-paid job and despite of my bad university exam result I was accepted by private university thanks to my father's slightly good income. I finished my university education without defect. After a while working in industry I started my own business with my friend and we fucked up. I lost my whole save. Along this time political situations in my country messed up, currency lost value aprox %370 and inflation increased %290. Now living with my family in a poor neighborhood and its streets are very dangerous. Now I have to spend one day with spending under $3. All my friends from high-school and university enjoy their life, have luxury cars, bought house and premium watches. 

Now I try to move a western country to make some money. But I am rejected all my job applications. Requesting 1-2$ from my family hurts me and breaks my heart while my friends traveling around world. The worst one is knowing too many specifications about the things and being poor that to can't afford them.

The never ending cycle,0,"I just feel like nothing matters anymore. Hearing family talk to friends on the phone and hearing them talk about normal things just seems like a waste. The things I used to do when I was happy, talk about anything and everything, now all just seems so pointless to talk about.

I no longer enjoy anything. Everything I enjoyed at some point in my life just seems boring and a waste of time. Seeing normal people do normal things and things that are supposed to be fun, and even seeing celebrities do things that are ""normal"" and meant to be fun, just makes me wonder, ""why?"". Why are they surfing, why are they standing outside talking to a friend while smoking a cigarette? What let them to do that and why aren't they doing something else? Can something lead me to do something enjoyable or even normal?

I've never been suicidal because I was never this bad, but this cycle of feeling this way and going deeper into depression because of it is making it really hard to cope with life.

My entire life people tell me I'm good looking and they have had crushes on me, yet anytime someone gets to know me, they go the other way. What makes me so horrible? I can understand now, because I don't even want to be with me, but what about before it got this bad?

There was this one girl that has always told me she's loved me, but she's been married for 12 years and now has 6 kids. She told me that she wishes I was the one that married her and had kids with her, yet recently we actually starting talking more seriously about it. We saw each other in person for the first time in 15 years and a month later she ghosted me. She almost never responds to me anymore after saying all of the things we want in the future together.

I'm starting to think there's no hope for me and there's only one way out, yet I'm too weak to actually do it. The thought gets stronger by the day.

I wish I could cry,34,"(20M)

I probably should’ve used a throwaway, but at the same time I can’t be arsed, since nobody irl is gonna end up finding my Reddit of all things.

The crux of the problem is that I just can’t really cry. I tear up occasionally from a book, or a particularly sad movie scene, but that seems to be my limit. 

I’ve got plenty I want to cry about right now. My life’s been spiralling since Covid, but the kicker is that I can’t even blame the shitty pandemic. Everything wrong with my life is because of me, and I’m tired of lying to my friends and family about having everything in order.

I don’t think any of my problems are going to miraculously fix themselves if I cry, but I’ve heard it’s an effective way at venting, and at this point I’m sick of feeling like this. I just want an opportunity to wallow in some pity and not focus on how much of a piece of shit I am.

But I haven’t cried since I was 14, and at the time I was glad I grew out of my crybaby phase, but all I want to do now is bawl under my covers, because I need some kind of distraction. This numbness isn’t letting me do anything but dig deeper into my own mind and find more reasons to hate myself.

If anyone’s got sure-fire ways to make myself cry, I’m completely open to them, but at this point I honestly think I’d be open to any kind of topic to distract me till I inevitably fall asleep, so hit me if there’s anything else.",13sss8f,Izuwoo,1685146173.0,121,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sss8f/i_wish_i_could_cry/,,Depression

Even the few people I believe are worthy of my respect I just have no desire to be around others anymore. I keep praying that when I die I’ll end up in a vacuum where I can’t tell where the darkness ends and I begin. Not everyone deserves to be hated, but I don’t like other people anymore. Not even the ones I cared about, sometimes I think they could be hit by a car and I’d do nothing but point and laugh. All while I still feel it’s my job to care for them, because I’m the only one who will. Isn’t that sad? All I can think about is how fucked up it is that I hate these innocent creatures and good people to the bastard death, how I’d love to see them chopped up and smeared on the pavement, but I’m the only one who even Tries to care for them. I’ll keep living because I don’t want my shit inherited by a bunch of sniveling freaks who won’t even share with their own toddlers. The little ones love me, I was kind to them when nobody else would be. Isn’t it messed up how much I want to see their corpses strung out and dismembered? They’ll never know how much I hate them. Because I keep acting like I love them. Because it’s the right thing to do, I don’t want bad karma. I wish suicide was as easy as everyone pretends it is, I’d do anything to off myself. But I’m not in the mood to deal with the afterlife. I want to separate myself from everything I was, destroy myself and born anew I’ll be somebody different, I won’t recognize the faces of those who once loved me. I won’t care about them at all, I want to run away and start over, I don’t care who or what I leave behind. I hate them all so much but this loneliness scratches at my skin and it roars louder now than ever before. Don’t make me pick up the call again, I don’t want to go anymore.

I went from failing every class in 9th grade, with no friends, to almost managing c’s in 10th, and then attempting suicide in 11th. I have straight A’s now, even a 96 in calc, and many of my teachers privately tell me that my work is the best they’ve seen, they love my knowledge, and ideas etc, but I don’t really care. My healthcare has been shut down, and I’m at home 24/7. I go between writing, school, and working out all day. I feel like a hamster in a wheel. Ive been tested, and I know I’m autistic and a genius, but it seems so pointless. Because of my depression and attempted sucide I’m not going to a place where I can pursue the education I want, I’m not going to be able to become Air Force Special Warfare because of my medication, and I don’t think I’ll ever make a true connection with someone. There are so many things I’m battling, and I keep fighting, but people are fighting against me. I can do school work with adderall, and I can get out of bed with lexapro, but why should I? I don’t think I’ll ever make it to the place I should be. Every time I try I am forced back into the abyss, and I don’t have much motivation to continue. I want to be able to socialize, I want a girl freind, I want to fall in love, I want to want friends, I want my brain to work properly, I want medical treatment, I want to make Special Warvare and pursue number theory and aerospace engineering. “Leave out conditions, unstable conditions will drag this dream into existence.”

I think I'm going to kill myself,7,"hey so I'm 19m and I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was around 10 years old. 

as the title says I think I'm gonna kill myself. I dropped out of college and I ended up losing contact with all of my friends. my girlfriend of just over a year broke up with me after drunkenly cheating on me and I'm in absolute shambles. she was the last thing I had left in my life and everything I was working towards was for her. now everything's gone. my future is no more, I don't talk to my friends anymore, I live in a small town so I can't go out and meet people, and now my girlfriend just left me.

my brain is stuck on two things: my ex and downing the hard prescription drugs that my parents keep around and I'm starting to think less and less about my ex and more about the drugs. I have no one at all and I feel like I'm being driven to insanity. 

I don't know what to do anymore other than to die. and it doesn't help that all the memories of my ex keep flooding back to me. our first kiss, the cuddling, the road trips we took, the things we saw, the last time we kissed. it's all too much for me to handle. I just love her so much and I can't stand not being with her so I think I'm gonna do it. this is a spare account I use for posting things that people I know can't see but I don't post here often.

I am getting ready to ruin an amazing opportunity because of my depression,1,"Hi everyone! To start off with, I am 25 years old and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder when I was a teenager along with an ADHD diagnosis in my adolescence. I have had periods in school where I was exceptional and others where I failed because I gave up, so what I am about to talk about is nothing new in my patterns of behavior. I was also raised by an emotionally abusive BPD and narcissistic mother who I had a codependent relationship with, so it was very hard for me to be successful in all aspects of my life. I somehow made it through taking mostly all AP courses, was active in extracurricular activities and was straight edge my entire high school. I went to college and got my degree which was a major struggle of its own, but fast forward to today where I have my first adult job as a junior business analyst. 

  I have been at this company for two and a half years now and excelled for the first 1.5 years to where I was offered an internship for a business analyst position when I previously only worked as a call center specialist. I did great in that, graduated from the program and ended up in the role I am in today. It has been such a surprise to me that I have become successful at a young age that I do feel undeserving at times. I did work extremely hard and could consider myself a workaholic at the time. Even after my internship I was predicted to have my full business analyst position in Summer 2023 (which is now December 2023). However, in November of 2022, I found out my estranged mother who I had not spoken to for 2 years was diagnosed with Stage 5 Early Onset Alzheimers. 
  
  I have never had to deal with something as hard in my life as this is. Watching her slowly degrade, not having the money to help my family who she lives with who are very poor, and seeing her not being able to perform basic tasks has absolutely killed me. I cry almost every day and have an extremely hard time talking to her. Because of this news, my work productivity absolutely plummeted and I pretty much lied / ghosted about the work that I was doing. I have a work from home job and now a days all i want to do is sleep. I am forgetting essential tasks at work to where I have become someone who was told that they would one day have an executive position to being told that if I keep doing what I am doing, the question is not going to be if I will receive a promotion by the end of the year, rather if I am worth keeping at this company. I was someone who was once respected and is now looked as a self fulfilling prophecy. I always worry about getting fired and now it was pretty much threatened. 

  My question for everyone is advice on how to get back on track. I can’t even do a full 8 hour day anymore it has gotten so bad. I am just so tired and depressed all the time. I do take medication which does help, but I have a hard time being consistent with it. I know I just need to have more discipline but I can’t help but think that it is already set in stone they plan to fire me. I’m just can’t believe I am on the path to ruin my dream careers They all know about my situation, and have been as accommodating as they can be so this is all on me. I just feel so helpless.",13ss4nl,monstermoneyandweed,1685144439.0,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ss4nl/i_am_getting_ready_to_ruin_an_amazing_opportunity/,,Depression
I have no friends and I just need someone to read this and maybe help me,1,This will be a little of a rant but I’m hoping at least 1 person takes a little to care about this stranger for a little. So a little bit about me is I grew up with a single carribean mother who cared more about my success than my happiness. She actually preached about how friends will ruin you and strongly pushed for me not to have any. Despite of that fact as a child I did have a few friends of which she of course strongly disapproved of. All of them eventually moved away to different states and I slowly lost touch with them. This stayed constant until I reached high school where I met a strong group of friends at school who I loved dearly and for the first time in my life I felt truly happy and secure. I was also talking to some friends at my church so things were really on the upside. Then disaster struck in my Freshman year of college. My “best friend” at the time who we will call Jason started to not like me because a there was a girl who I liked and she liked me too but he liked her. Then he started to tell my church friends things about me and I lost touch with them. At the same time he started to do events with my friends from high school and not invited me which eventually disconnected us. He even told the girl (who I am still dating to this day) things about me to try paint me in a bad picture which I know now from talking to my girlfriend. I have no one except her and I’m not ungrateful but I really wish I had a group of people all to myself. I still see them all plan events and exclude me but whenever they need anything I love them so much that I’m always there for them. I don’t know what to do and I just want people. I hate that I get these suicidal thoughts because I don’t want to die. I just want to know if there’s anyone who can relate to me and help me thanks.,13ss22w,issajay__,1685144250.0,5,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13ss22w/i_have_no_friends_and_i_just_need_someone_to_read/,,Depression

Depressed?,3,"24F. I’ve never identified as depressed. I’ve never called myself that. I’ve had anxiety for 8+ years. I’ve never thought I was depressed because I don’t want to die and I don’t want to hurt myself and I can still find joy in life. But the joy is always fleeting. It never lasts long and sometimes it feels like I’m not even happy, I’m just doing something that used to make me happy so I say I am. I can’t tell if things truly being me joy or I’m just remembering the joy I used to feel.

I’ve never wanted to die but I do find myself thinking how things would be so much easier and better for others around me if I simply never existed to begin with. My parents wouldn’t be dealing with some of the issues they have now, my brother wouldn’t have to deal with his sister being so lost and floating in life when he’s already stressed out with his own life, my friends wouldn’t have to worry about me, etc. It’s not like I want to die but I wish I never existed at all.

I was talking with my mom and it was really difficult because she was describing how she feels like she has to keep reminding me to put in the work to change, to work on myself. There were some things that happened a few months ago that we’re both working through so it’s not like this conversation was for no reason. But she asked me how I wanted things to be and I just said “I want things to be easy.” And at one point she said that sometimes life is easy but at other times it’s not, and I just found myself thinking that life hasn’t been easy for so long that I can’t even remember when I thought it was. And that got me thinking, that maybe there is something more wrong with me- not that there’s anything wrong with people with depression, that’s not the best way for me to describe it, more like I started thinking that maybe there’s something wrong like chemically with my brain.

I didn’t know where to turn to or who to ask, I’m in counseling but have no broached this with my therapist for fear that maybe I’m confused or don’t really know what’s going on. Can anyone here identify with these feelings? I’m just so confused and could use some advice.",13srthl,silverivy_13,1685143628.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13srthl/depressed/,,Depression

I feel trapped and alone,1,"I'm still a kid. I'm a queer, gnc, autistic/ADD kid who has no completely trusted adult figures in their life. The world is literally so fucking messed up. People are hated for who they love, who they don't love, what they identify as, how much melanin their skin has, how big or small they are, etc. Our earth is literally wasting away but these stupid old white men could care less as long as they're making money. My family is christian and transphobic and even homophobic to a degree, and extremely ""I'm the adult, you're the child, what I say goes"" type authoritative. Yeah, I have friends my age who are like me, but it's not the same as having a close and trusted adult. I've been called ungrateful for just that statement alone. 
All people want is money. All people care about is money. There's a certain stupid ""system"" that the world has, and if it's broken, they ""cover it up"" and sweep it under the rug. Big companies are literally killing other people just to keep this ""order"". Role models I've had since childhood are turning out to be just like that. My life is filled with so many of these adults who joke about whooping their kids if they so much as try to open up to them. And parents wonder why their kids don't come to them and commit suicide and run away from home. 
I'm so sick and tired of all the hate and greed and "" you're wrong, I'm right because I'm older and have more experience"". I'm so afraid that when gen z become the adults, there won't be a fucking world for them to live on. We, gen z, are the ones who are gonna have to pick up the pieces after all of this and we don't even know how or where to start. 

With all of this going on in my life, I'm at the point where I feel like it's me that's doing the wrong things. Sometimes I feel like I should just give in and be the christian god-loving, normal, straight, flat-earther, body-hating country girl that every adult in my life wants me to be. Maybe I am in the wrong. Maybe I should cut off all my queer friends. Maybe I should start seeing trans women as a threat. Maybe I should become a true american republican. I don't want to do any of these things, but if it keeps the peace and makes everyone still love me, then it looks like I don't have another fucking choice.

Is it possible for those with depression to have meaningful friendships?,0,"Its just hard to maintain them and when you keep canceling on people they tend to just not care anymore. I'm rarely in a happy mood and it makes me sad to see people go out regularly with their friends and socialize properly. Why go out if I'm in a bad mood you know? I feel so empty all the time. Its rare when I get those moments where I can talk for a while and genuinely have a good time. 

My ex was the only person to really push me to go out and he eventually got tired of it. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life but I'm understanding I may have to accept that. I want socialization but then I get exhausted and when I'm out I want to go back home. Its a lonely and exhausting cycle. There was only really one person I could sit with forever and not feel pressured to perform and that was my ex.

I've got too much going on and I don't have any support (UK),0,"30F, had depression since my teens and anxiety for 8+ years

Here's a list -

- I'm waiting for an autism assessment so my area won't give me any sort of therapy until I have a diagnosis

- I have oral surgery next week due to 3 rotting wisdom teeth, I've waited a year and in the last 2 months I've lost 3 stone because I can't even take liquids without agony, I'm only 8 stone now, I got to a healthy weight now it's gone

- I woke up this morning with tonsilitis so I'm scared surgery will be cancelled

- I'm in the middle of police interviewing because my ex r*ped me and with a PTSD diagnosis a few months after I left him, went for EMDR therapy and couldn't have it because of the autism assessment

- I don't have any support network and I just deal alone constantly and all I'm doing is crying recently, I came off my meds because I moved out of my parents and I'm unable to wake myself up on them. They were the last resort as all other meds didn't work for me

I guess I’m depressed …?,7,"I don’t really identify as depressed - there’s no melancholy just a persistent apathy.

In other words I just don’t seem to have the energy and drive that most people have, and it doesn’t seem to be caused by any pathology.

I don’t feel particularly lacking in energy but relative to most others I am , quite often I’ll turn down events and things with friends because I’m mentally exhausted and half hearted towards them. 

This has led a few people to unofficially diagnose me with depression because it’s so bizarre to them that someone would have such an apathetic attitude toward friends and socialising.

I do have bursts of passion and energy toward hobbies and things but for the most part I am pretty impassive and lacking in motivation. If the house burns down then the house burns down sort of attitude. 

I often look around at people wondering how the fuck they have so much drive and energy… they’re doing the same thing every week like hamsters on a wheel and yet they have such energy- work all week, go out Friday and Saturday night, play sport Sunday morning, work on their two side hustles Sunday afternoon… I assume a lot of it is ego driven but even so I can’t believe it.

Im tired and I’m not sure what to do. This might be an unpopular opinion but I think people with chronic depression and anxiety should be forthcoming with whoever they date.

I'm tired,2,"I'm 26F. Moved to Canada from Pakistan three months ago. A few weeks after getting here I went to a psychiatrist and he started tapering my benzos. I've been tapering for 3 months. I just stopped them a few days ago. Throughout this time I've been sick and lonely but leaving the last little pill has been extra hard on me. The doctor told me not to work during this tapering time. I stopped benzos for the first time since last March after a few months of tapering so my body is reacting to it.

I've had a history of Depression and Anxiety for the last four years, so you can imagine how tired I am

I had to change my medication last year this time as well, I had a few good months before I had to move here. It's been downhill ever since

I feel so lonely. Everyone that I do know are so busy and involved in their lives (distant family). I can't keep bothering people with my depression, it's too heavy on them and they get sick of me. I don't even want to bother my own brother or my best friend. Talking is so hard these days, it's too hard to talk, and what I have is too heavy to communicate

I miss home so much. I have a husband who's stuck by me but I still feel so alone. My heart is always pounding and I'm always sick. I can't even communicate with my therapist all the time, just once a week, which helps for half a day.

I don't see a future. I don't know what I want to do with my life career wise. I don't have a place to meet new people since I'm home trying to recover and doing house chores (which have been too exhausting for the past week)

Sometimes I think no one would care if I didn't exist. People's lives will go on busy like right now and I'll take the pain with me

In denial?,1,"I really don't know what depression looks like. I don't wanna recognize its face, afraid that it would picture myself. But recently I'm slowly realizing something, something I wish I never did.

I always thought it was just part of my personality. An introvert who loves being alone, hates social interaction as it drains her. Who loves spending her life at home and rarely goes out. Hates light as it hurts her eyes, so she embraced the dark. She, who hates noise and would cry over it.  Someone who's not good at expressing herself or showing affection, not good with words so people deemed her as the ""cold hearted"" one.

But why does she find it hard to fall asleep? She'll say it's just insomnia or something like ""I'm just a night owl who loves a peaceful night"" When the truth is, she spends every night overthinking about things that are out of her control. If she ever fall asleep all she dreamed of is not waking up. She never wanna end her life as she was taught it's a sin, how she wish she never learned that so it would be easier to just disappear without needing to say goodbye.

Everyday she find herself waking up (against her will) so she lay in her bed hours after hours, thinking when will it ends.

She started skipping meals and would often wonder why she's losing weight. She hated her body so she planned to get back on track but on second thought she'd die anyway, what's the use. She's not afraid of dying and no longer look forward for what's yet to come. 

She found herself biting her nails and lips all throughout the day, it became her new addiction. It hurts, and would leave some scar, but she somewhat enjoys the pain.

She hates that she's sad and wouldn't understand why. ""What's making me sad?"", she asked herself but answers are not found. As per the society she don't have much reason to feel sad, her life is better compared to others and she should have a lot to be grateful of.

I have lost my mind,12,"I got woken up by my mother's loud voice and the cat screaming. I was feeling angry because of this. Went to sleep in the afternoon and when I woke up I still felt sad. Whole day I just felt sad. I cried just a while ago, it's 1 am right now.    
    
I hate it, I hate living, I hate my family, friends, myself and everything. I'm a failure and I won't do anything good with my life.    
    
I don't talk with anyone at home because I realised it's like talking to a wall, my parents don't understand shit they just expect me to do what they wish and they get mad If I don't live my life according to them. So I havev stopped talking to them. Both my sisters are selfish, narcissistic pieces of shit and I realised they only care about themselves so I stopped talking to them as well. At home I usually just scroll through my phone. I can't move out because no job, can't get a job because can't focus at home, can't focus at home because my family is too loud. If I ask them to lower their voice they yell even more, why? Because I'm the youngest of the family and how dare I order the elders. My cat is a screamer if he is awake he is screaming and family totally enables his behaviour  they say he is talking. Almost everyday I get woken up because of how loud my family is. They have absolutely no regard for me. For years my sleep has been disturbed like this. When I get mad and start acting out they say I don't express myself and they are willing to listen but that is all a lie if I tell them what I feel, why I am mad they just listen to it and ignore it. Next time they use it against me or try to make it look like it's no big deal.    
    
I'm retarded. I feel like I might have undiagnosed autism because all my childhood tilll now I have had trouble forming and maintaining relationships. I didn't realise my lack of friends in school but as soon as school was over I started to realise how lonely I am. In general I used to be annoying so people didn't like me then I became so silent that I have become boring. If people talk to me then it just feels like they want something from me and they just want to use me. I act so unbothered by everyone and everything that people just lose interest in me. I have nothing special about me. I don't have any interests now so I can't bond with people over common interests either. I keep beating myself for not saying yes to this one girl in 7th grade. I regretted it everytime I saw her in college, she would just give me the angry look or some weird look I can't describe. I said no to her because I thought it was joke and that a girl like her wouldn't actually like me. I was too retarded in 7th grade no fucking way I could've made her happy. I just think about how things would've been different if I had said yes. I keep making up scenarios as if we are together. It just hurts. I've lost my chance with her already and it justs hurts that we can't be together and that someday she would be someone else's.    
    
I don't have any close friends. If I try to talk about what's on my mind my friends just lose interest or change the topic. In every group I'm that guy who could be gone and no one would notice. In every group it feels like they have their own thing going on which I'm not a part of and it makes me feel left out.

I'm slipping into another episode,2,"I'm slipping into another depressive episode and i feel like i have no one to talk to, so i'll just post it on here. i (18f) just graduated high school and i'm going into college in my state. A lot of my friends who were in the same fine arts program as me are going to a different nearby state to a college that is a bit harder to get in to. 

My best friend, let's call her chelsea, is going to that college in the other state, which i don't really mind because i get that people will go to different places after high school. However the problem lies in the fact that chelsea has become closer with a different girl, who we'll call amanda, and has become best friends with her instead of me. that might sound selfish until i mention that i had a crush on amanda and told chelsea that i liked her and to not be super touchy or anything, just as she had done with me and her crush at a different time.

however, amanda and chelsea grew closer and became touchier despite me telling chelsea i didn't like that. they hold hands, lean their heads on each others shoulders and are practically attached at the hip. 

i won't go super into detail about all this, but chelsea grew to believe that i was jealous, when in reality she made me feel so left out and disposed. (i had already lost feelings for amanda at that point and moved on but the betrayal is what hurts)

i've been rethinking everything and i've begun wondering if i'm a failure for choosing an easier college that's closer to my home. i've also been mourning the loss of a friend i thought would stick by me for the long run. i feel like i'm stupid and selfish and i've been feeling so lonely because while my friends are everything to me, im not everything to them and that thought makes me feel super alone.

anyways, all this including the stress of being an upcoming college student and one of my parents getting mad at me for something i didn't do and kicking me out for a night has caused me to be suicidal and contemplate self harm, which i've been clean of for roughly 3 years. i feel lost and tired and sad, and i'd like some comforting words or guidance.",13slo5o,Contorted_Taco,1685127999.0,6,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13slo5o/im_slipping_into_another_episode/,,Depression

"I think my depression is returning, and I don’t have the strength to put up a fight again",0,"My first depressive bout was 2011, and last was in 2018–2020. Both made me suicidal. I grew up in a violently abusive home with a narcissistic father, so I had my work cut out for me. I had/have done a lot of therapy and was happily living thinking I was ‘cured’ since then. For the last ~6 weeks, familiar symptoms have come back. Sleeping constantly, no motivation to exercise, my body feeling heavy and lethargic so I just wanted to be in bed. 

I saw the doctor about 3 weeks ago and my bloods came back showing I had low vitamin D and a (symptomless) infection that she said was likely the source of the lethargy and which was treated with antibiotics. Nonetheless, I don’t feel any better, and in fact I feel even more depressed. 

This morning, my husband had to do things he did the last time—he carried me out of bed (otherwise I won’t get up) and stood me in the sunshine on our balcony. He recited strengthening and encouraging words in my ear and told me to hold my head up (my depression posture is me unconsciously making myself as small as possible). He walked me slowly to the couch and then sat me down and fed me tea. I had a distinct thought that I would make such a shit mum (something I wanted before this bout) if a poor child had to see me in such a powerless and frightening state; I felt no one deserved a mum like me. 

I started melting down and told my husband that if I am going back to that place, I am not putting up a fight this time. I fought hard for years to stay alive the last time. But I’m not doing that again. I could easily sneak out in the night without anyone knowing and go to the train station near my home and just end it. 

I’m seeing the doctor again tomorrow and I feel sad and scared, and so small. All over again. I don’t want this to be my life, and I don’t know how to get free.

Getting normal?? Not so fast…,1,"Hi everybody!
I’m 31, I’ve been fighting depression and panic disorder for 10 years now. There were always better and worse episodes. I made it through college, doing my masters now, but took-up drinking…
Well that didn’t go well with all the pills. I quit drinking and fought off my Xanax addiction. Life was good, only good, not great. I didn’t feel joy, or enjoyed small things, like my hobbies. Finally in January I got really bad, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward in hospital. I got out about 2 months ago. My new meds are really good, I don’t have any bad thoughts, but I’m feeling just ok, not great. Happening again. I feel joy and great when I drink or on controlled substances, but I know I can’t do those… they would kill me. So I feel just OK… going to work, studying and attending university, coming home, watching the telly, sleeping. That’s it. I don’t find joy in anything, I don’t feel the urge to do my old hobbies. I just feel fine. And I’m fed up… My life is messed up. Literally the only thing  I love and find a little joy in is playing the Diablo games, they remind me of my childhood.

I’m currently going through school in a doctorate level healthcare profession and majored in Chem with a bio minor, so the science and treatment part of this I get. My main question lies in the anecdotal self-reported feelings: how did antidepressants make you feel? 

A little about my situation: I feel like I have severe bouts of depression, noticeable by people around me. I have adhd and I’m being treated for it. Adhd plays into my problems imo. Mind races, restlessness, etc. adhd meds seem to help, but like I said before, people in my life sort of opened my eyes to the fact that emotional regulation and sudden plateaus in mood caused by my somewhat sensitive nature may be something to consider. 

I’ve tried therapy and I feel like I am good at regulating the “rationalization” portion of my problem and incorporating solutions when needed, but things still seem bleak and all the aforementioned issues still pester my life. 

Obviously as anyone (even as a future healthcare practitioner who’s been educated on the topic) who has lived in our world that demonizes rx drugs I’m nervous on how it will affect my thinking, life, personality, etc. 

I will definitely look through the sub and do my best to do my own research on people’s personal experiences, but if you guys could be so kind, could you please provide some advice/personal stories/reassurance regarding what’s happening and whether I should speak to my doc about this? 

Thanks!",13sijwd,Rootin_Tootin44,1685120245.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sijwd/could_i_get_some_advice_on_my_situationstarting/,,Depression

"my last day :,)",3,"i am very happy as today will be my last day suffering. i plan to have a nice day and lay myself to rest tonight. 

i have been suffering for 6 year now, since the age of 12 when i was diagnosed with clinical depression. i don’t see any reason to live nor do i want to live for anyone else. i figure night time is the best time to end my life, as everyone else would be sleeping and there would be nothing they can do to stop it. 

i am 18 and don’t think adulthood seems worth half the trouble. i’m tired of working and recently withdrew from college to pursue this goal of ending my life. 

i woke up this morning and the time just seems right. i have spent my entire morning breaking down periodically and i have decided the best thing i can do for myself is to end my suffering. 

i am no longer close to anyone, as i started distancing myself from friends in march. i don’t want to wake up anymore and don’t want to see another day. 

i don’t think anyone could say anything to change my mind. i simply came here to ask if there’s anything i should do today to make the most of it.",13si8j6,Brilliant-Gold2299,1685119514.0,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13si8j6/my_last_day/,,Depression

It doesn’t stop,0,"Depression is eating me alive at this point. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can barely bring myself to take care of my dogs. My relationship feels like it’s crumbling and I feel absolutely powerless in everything that I do. I haven’t felt this low in so so long. 

I feel truly alone. There’s nobody there to help me pick up the pieces this time and I’m not really sure I even want to try to get help. 

Suicide ideation and self harm have resurfaced. I haven’t felt that way in so so long. I kind of forget how oddly comforting and addicting it is to feel that way. Like a really negative crutch to lean on. 

I’m 21 and life seems very very worthless to me. I can’t even remember my childhood and it feels like I have missed such a huge chapter of my life and skipped straight into adulthood, where I can’t even keep myself afloat. I can’t keep a job, I keep house hopping. I don’t have any future plans or goals and I don’t feel like I deserve to even have a future.

Prozac and alcohol,4,"I’m thinking of starting Prozac and have been putting it off for a while because i have events that cause me to be drinking or away from normal situations constantly and have no big enough gap to take them when i wont be doing anything to see how i react. My main worry is drinking and being on them, i do not want to have to give up nights out and my main issue is not necessarily that alcohol will counter act the anti depressants, being a depressant itself, my main worry is if they will make me more sick and give worse hangovers when mixing them. I want to start them on the 29th, but have prom on the 9th. Prom is big and i want to be able to enjoy it and have fun with a few drinks without having to worry about being sick or extremely drowsy.

I really want to give up.,2,"15M.

I have been talking to my father about me 10 years later when I suddenly cried, realizing there will be no me 10 years later.

I am a ""genius""—certified IQ of 165, quick-witted, highly intelligent, etc. Most people will expect me to be fairly successful in my later life, and I will be quite happy now.

That's definitely not the case.

I am constantly haunted by my mind, thinking that I cannot fail. Nobody I met have actually imagined what kind of pressure I am actually in. I had to endure expectations from all around me, and unpleasant experiences with my classmates, and so on and so forth, especially that I am living in a city that is way too competitive for normal humans to live in. But then I'm still trying to sound normal, trying to cope with what's coming.

Thing start to get worse since last December.

I had a crush on a guy in my class. I can't go into details, but he actually thinks I am damn annoying, and thus he's frequently mocking me. And he's straight, too. I told myself to give up, but I just couldn't. So I fell into this cycle where I realize can't have him, think about him, try to get his attention, and get mocked by him—never ends.

This really made me want to give up on life.

I have thought of this many times. I have actually done more harm than good to people around me. This made me feel even more confused—should I give up right now to minimize my damage, or should I try to redeem whatever I've done before finally dying?

Sorry if I bothered you (my mother always says so when I brought up the slightest of this issue), but Reddit is my last hope. If you don't help me, I don't know what to do.

Venting to the void,1,"I don't even really know where to start on this...i feel forgotten. I try my best to reach out to people and say hi, but I'm not getting anything in return. I got covid this week and, although not bad, no one checked up on me. I'm 100% sure that if I stopped initiating conversation with folks I wouldn't talk to anyone besides coworkers.

I don't know what to do at this point... And yes I've talked to therapists but that's not helping at all. Just making me feel more depressed.

"Part of my story, vent.",0,"25. Been on meds. Had therapy, soforth. Anyone I talk to is awkward. Any time I share my like, no one is interested. I can tell, it's just that nobody shares my interests. I don't hate them for it. Burned out of college, now 7 years later. Can't do jobs. Stroke-like symptoms after every social interaction. Eyelid drooping, eyes unfocusing, headache, bellyache, hard to breathe, exhausted, no positive motivation to do anything. I feel like staring, but I realised years ago that that actually does never end. I stared as a kid. Just endlessly. Daydreaming, listening to my environment, just breathing. Can't do anything creative because halfway during I lose my drive. Pushing myself past it is not an option, it just makes me nauseous and confused. I smoke cigarettes, watch movies and drink coffee, all day. I live in a govt guided living building where counselors have specific instructions to basically leave me alone as much as possible. Appointments, chores, requirements, they just get me in a rut that eventually burns me out. Spent years piecing together how and why this happens. I see now, but still no way to actively change that. Meds don't change the fact that I don't share interests with anybody, the fact that I feel dead when I am working on automatic. Legally declared 100% unfit for work. Have had years-long relationships. Ended them because I wasn't happy and I knew I wasn't going to keep up the effort that goes into being healthy for someone. Friends at this point just feel like an exercise for my social skills. Just going through the motions that are recommended for this type of scenario, though I know from experience and study that it does not work. Best I can do now is make the most of what I have, as anything I set out to do ends up crushing my spirit by becoming a massive, complicated chore. I never wanted to become this, but I would choose this over a meaningless 9-to-5 life of eternal work. Head counselor asked me to do IQ test to make me available for different treatment so other counselors could be told to not try and push the standard treatments on/with/to me. Turns out my IQ is not measurable under 160. Great, but I can't do anything with it. I live in a glass box, I have no hands. That's what this feels like. I try new things once in a while. Can't name any sport except fierljeppen that I haven't tried. Tried anything ranging from knitting to playing instruments. I do overtone singing, recently figured out how to do subharmonics. I figure that I can keep doing certain difficult things because those still have nostalgic value and because those make me feel like I am getting closer to solving this mess, even though I know it is not bringing me closer. Had psychotic episodes years ago, with relevant meds and therapy. Neither of those did anything. Even the experimental new meds did nothing but exhaust me, numb me and make me endlessly hungry. Tried hypnosis, CBT. It doesn't work because it doesn't change how I look at the world, and I wouldn't want to. I'm no one if not what makes me me. I can generate emotions anytime I want, but I can't keep them, and I can't make them flow in a pattern to keep them going. Studied psychology and whatnot to give me an edge over this thing. Sure, it's better than it used to be, but the fundamental issue is still there, and I don't think it'll ever be resolved unless I do it myself or some superintelligent A.I. starts homing in on the key details that keep me stuck in this rut. I can talk forever, I can generate entire movies in my head, but I don't see a point. I can't reach anyone, no one can be by my side. I can't trust anyone. I can manipulate well. I don't ever want to, and I hated this since I was very young. Better to distract an angry man by using a dirty trick than let him get himself into a fight that isn't good for either of us. People around me constantly getting into troubles that I can solve, and I sometimes do, but again, it just becomes a chore and I lose the energy to do it. There's 9 billion people that have ancestors which had the same problems. I live in a group of people that think it's okay to repeat mistakes for thousands of years. Everyone walking around making children and hurting them the same way they have been hurt. Nobody making systems to solve these problems. Everyone mocking me for even considering it even when I come up with something that I tested on hundreds of people, patiently, deliberately, carefully. When I share something I made, people do one of three things. Ignore it, hate it or ""magnet it to the fridge"". Some people try to understand how I work, but they can't, and having consistently and meticulously studied how people work, I can now see why. I can't just start fixing everybody. People tell me a joke that I've heard before. Can't laugh, so I'll try to entertain them with one. If they laugh, I'm bored because I know what subtype of person laughs at that joke and they have now become completely predictable, behaving like a program in a computer. The world seems dead. I'm like that, too. My life has always seemed like a movie, so I just stare. No point in doing, willing, acting, responding, but if I don't breathe, my body tortures me with horrible pain until I'm forced to become conscious and awake and then I have to breathe. What cruel experience that is. Because I'm acutely aware of all this, I feel for anybody, from family to strangers, dogs, cats, flies. It's existential. Who would make something like this? It's horrible, terrible, but ofcourse, none of this is something you'd be forced to consciously acknowledge unless you are sifting at depths and crevices such as these just for the minute chance you find something that helps get you out of this mess. I know no one that can relate. I have spoken with _thousands_, including irl. Went to all the kinds of places you'd go to for the chance of a remotely related shared interest. I like technology, so I'll go to workshops and conventions. Nothing! No one! All I like is myself and sharing me with anybody just makes me feel severely awful.

Sometimes it makes you jealous more than it makes you sad.,2,"I have never been anywhere in my life. We never had the money. we still dont. finished our exams today, and sat around talking with some people. two of them are leaving tonight for a small couples get away. One of them is going on a week long vacation. rest of them had a blast going drinking. i sat there like my usual fucking self. an outsider, watching people live their lives and trying so hard to be a part of something and failing at it. I eventaully left, because I had responsibilities anyway. 

what is it like, being so carefree? thinking about your next trip, or the next date, or the next time you hang out with your friends? whats it like not having to think and rethink about logistics? about having to give up something in order to enjoy something else?mark off things in your little mental calendar to do for when youre 25, 30, 40 or maybe 50? and never getting to do that? what does it feel like to be so genuinely happy, to be so well looked after, to have things to be happy about and not the constant nagging fear of things going terribly wrong all the time? 

some people have it a little easy. I am not ashamed to say i hate those people. I just do.

I feel ashamed of how bad I’m actually doing - finding it harder than ever to socially navigate depression in my mid 20s,0,"I (now 26m) was very depressed throughout most of high school, but then my life turned around in college and I felt more alive and vibrant than I ever have socially, physically, and spiritually. I felt like for the first time in my life people would tell me I am an uplifting person whose presence comforts them, and in general I felt such a great sense of purpose and excitement towards the future during those years.

Now I’m 26, and after being diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid disorder last year, my depression has come back with what feels like a vengeance. I feel like I’ve lost contact with that person I was just a few years ago who felt so full of passion and life force, and I’ve broken down crying just seeing pictures of myself from that time because I don’t know how to find that person within myself again. 

These days, I feel like I use most of the energy I do have to stay afloat in my full time job and keep up an appearance there that I am doing great. My friends know I’m going through stuff, but I am admittedly kind of ashamed to let them know the true depths of how desolate I feel. I know progress isn’t linear and depression can absolutely strike at any point in life, but subconsciously I think I do feel a gnawing sense of “embarrassment” that I overcame all of that depression from my teen years only to be back at what feels like square one and hardly any more equipped to deal with it than I was at 17.

I know my friends would be nothing but supportive and understanding if I opened up to them fully, but I still feel like there’s this unspoken social imperative I put on myself to not say anything quite bad enough to make anyone truly worry about me - even though I know if the situation were reversed, I would want these people to feel like they can be as raw and honest as they need to be with me about their mental state.  

I guess the fact of it is that as we’ve gotten further into our 20s, everyone’s life is so busy and a lot of my friends are going through very difficult times of their own. I truly believe my friends love and care about me, but I think everyone understandably has a natural limit of how emotionally available they can be for another adult who is falling apart while balancing their own busy adult life. And I think deep down I’m afraid that if people realize I am not the funny and enjoyable person I was in college, when I was filled with passion and wonder for life, I will slowly become more a source of stress than a pillar of support and mutually fulfilling friendship. 

I am not suicidal or going to harm myself (or anyone else of course), I’m certain of that, but I still feel this sense of desperation, almost like I just want to dramatically put my whole life on pause for a couple days and go to a hospital or something, but I don’t even really know why I’d tell them I was there. I guess in truth I just want to feel like my world has stopped for a couple days so I can drop the facade and people can intervene and pay attention to me and take care of me. which I honestly feel kind of selfish/guilty for, and I am not actually going to show up at any hospital and expect this - but that’s the best way I can put it, in terms of what it feels like I want. 

If anyone has read all of this, thank you so much. Has anyone else found that depression has hit them especially hard in their mid 20s? How do you navigate asking for support without feeling like you’re treading on unspoken social etiquettes about respecting the high stress levels in everyone else’s life? I do have a therapist and am probably starting medication again soon, but it’s still been so hard even with that.",13sf9hu,henofthewoods1,1685112609.0,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sf9hu/i_feel_ashamed_of_how_bad_im_actually_doing/,,Depression
Am I over reliant on my antidepressants,0,"I am a Y6 student (18) going to take Alevels this year. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder earlier this year after about two years of neglecting all my symptoms…after about three weeks of being on Prozac my life kind of changed and got better, I was in a better mood and I regained motivation in life.(I was suicidal and had attempted suicide+OD) While things seemed to have gotten better for me I found out that maybe I was starting to develop symptoms of eating disorders. I was on an extreme restrictive diet, eating less than 200 calories a day. Then my mom started forcing me to eat more and I started gaining weight again(according to the people around me I have always been skinny, bmi is underweight but I just have a general dissatisfaction with my physique) And from then on I would start to experience episodes of my depression where things just get really bad. At first it was once in two weeks but now an episode can last for two days. It’s like my medication is no longer effective….Is this just general sadness or is it actually an episode. Am I starting to get reliant on my medication thinking that I will not experience sadness because I’m on it?

Getting out of numbness into aliveness,0,"The topic of aliveness was discussed recently on the Gathering Gold podcast

The concept of aliveness has come up in my individual therapy and briefly in group therapy. Well, its come up in the sense that I've been talking about the opposite ie. numbness, numbing out etc.

For me, numbness likely is a way that I'm protecting myself against how I was treated when I was younger. And it happens alot, numbness is almost my default mode, which is terrible.

I think defining aliveness is important, and its not just the highest of highs as discussed in the podcast but also what happens in day to day life.

What I'm starting to work on is trying to be more intentional about recognizing my feelings and trying to be present. Another things I mentioned to my therapist is that I've always felt that success would lead to good feelings (whatever success is - that's a whole other topic) but maybe I need to test flipping my thinking that good feelings leads to success.

Happy to hear anyone else's thoughts on this, its very topical for me.",13sf02k,gfyourself,1685111983.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sf02k/getting_out_of_numbness_into_aliveness/,,Depression
Waiting for the day to pass just so I can finally go to bed/Going through the motions,0,"I need to get it off one's chest somewhere about my life, emotions and everything.

I've been going through periods of depression for several years now, and as if out of habit, I went back to my old ways a few months ago.  
I'm going to be 19, I know I'm very young and that I have ""my whole life ahead of me"", but at the moment (and for a long time now) I don't see the point of my life anymore.   
I stopped my first year of university, I didn't like it and I couldn't keep up.  
I see friends who are already starting to make a success of their lives, working, earning money and experiencing the good things in life, but what am I? I have no love, no history, no hope for my future.   
For the moment, I spend my days waiting for the evening so that I can take my medication and go to bed, and I also wait until Friday night to go to the bar with friends, to drink and see people live. I'm going through the motions, and I feel like I'm stuck at this point in my life, watching people keep moving forward, moving to other beautiful cities and succeeding at everything I'm not.  
I know I'm young, beautiful, blue-eyed blondie with a ""perfect"" body, I had a good childhood, with financially well-off parents. I feel guilty about it, because compared to some people, my life has been easy...  
To externalize what I feel so deeply, I drink, I get laid, I'm promiscuous, I self-harm and almost voluntarily put myself in danger.  
I talk to my doctor about my condition, I can trust him, but now, apart from prescribing me a new antidepressant or a neuroleptic, I don't know what more he can do to help me.  
I can't live looking ahead, I stay in the past and ruminate on what I should have done, on past relationships, on my choice of studies, etc.   
I don't know what to do with my life, or how to make myself useful. I'm fed up of fake smiles.  
What should I do?

“Just because you’re sad doesn’t mean you have depression” did more harm than good for me.,0,"This past few days have been especially hard for me.. and it wasn’t until last night that I realized something; I have depression. I’ve been depressed for years, and I didn’t even realize. I received multiple diagnoses over a year ago; ASD, GAD, and an unspecified mood disorder. The mood disorder was very confusing to me and I didn’t expect to walk out with that one. 


Because of its stigma.. I didn’t realize I check most of the boxes. When I got that mood disorder diagnosis, it took me over a year to really look into & because of Toxic positivity and not knowing how I feel unless I make a very conscious effort to (alexithymia?), I didn’t exactly accept it . Depression and low self esteem were two things I denied and couldn’t see in myself. I’ve never felt suicidal, so I think that’s another reason I thought I didn’t have depression. I’ve been covering it up with school deadlines and stress on the daily for years, & and now that nothing’s going on it’s blatantly clear to me. And I’ve picked up on the pattern that on those waves.. I’m very self loathing. I’ve known this whole time that school makes me miserable.. that I hate it (though I love learning) but I haven’t ever explored that more because I feel like it’s something I don’t have a choice but to do. Like I’m trapped.. instead of wanting to end my life, running away to the middle of nowhere is the place my mind always went to. I haven’t taken my emotions seriously for years now.. only doing what I feel like I should and covering it up. Maybe that’s why I am so negative towards myself during those episodes. I’ve grown to loathe myself without even realizing. 

Now I’m wondering when it all started.. I think it was middle school.. maybe sooner.. is that when I started running from it I do wonder.",13sdu8j,Apprehensive-Author2,1685109120.0,11,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sdu8j/just_because_youre_sad_doesnt_mean_you_have/,,Depression
I wish I could disappear,0,"Not for the reasons anyone thinks.

I wish I could disappear instead of just killing myself because inevitably when people find out you killed yourself you get the fake pity. 

The strangers that had no idea you were alive but for one reason or another find out you committed suicide and suddenly are full of remorse that you didn’t reach out to someone for help. The friends that never bothered texting or trying to see you just suddenly full of grief and despair that they didn’t do those things when you were still here.  The family that forgot you existed suddenly coming out of the woodwork with how special you were.  Then 2 weeks later everyone has forgotten and you are just some body in the ground.

I don’t want their fake ass pity. They don’t care that I’m alive now, I don’t want their pity when I’m dead.  And yeah I realize I wouldn’t know if they did or not but I see it happen for others and all I can think is what a bunch of fake assholes who didn’t care about said person when they were still breathing but now that they are gone it’s just so sad *tear*",13sdu2v,Ghost91730,1685109108.0,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13sdu2v/i_wish_i_could_disappear/,,Depression

inside the mind of a 17 Year old boys (trauma induced) depressive thoughts,0,"The plan here is im just gonna type away, until I feel like I cant anymore, or I've gotten my point across.

Reading this over, I'm not the greatest writer, so a key detail here is that my mom and dad split up when i was like 2 years old, they had split custody of me at the time. bear with me here, thank you.

I have gone to therapy, but they consistently tell me to do pointless, pointless things. Like going to bed early, getting a full 8-9 hours in, I have tried it, but I knew going into it that it would never work. I have had depression for the last 2 years, but I never thought about it or had it diagnosed officially until a month ago. When I was 8 years old, roughly, it was a wednesday morning, 3:30 AM on a school morning when I woke up suddenly. It was abnormal of me to wake up at this hour and I really needed to go to the bathroom. My apartment at the time had 2 bathrooms, one of which was farther from my room, and smaller which i didnt like. for whatever reason, I was drawn to the bathroom I didnt like. I walked in, and there she was. My mom. She had a belt wrapped around her low shoulder/high bicep area, a needle sticking out of her elbow, vomit, just, everywhere im telling you. Her veins were popping a harsh black, thick color and she was ferociously seizing, I was so confused, I had no idea what drugs were, let alone heroin or other insanely hard drugs like that. I thought for sure she was dying, I called 911 just crying, so unfathomably hard, telling them my mom is going to die, and I dont know whats going on, Im alone, now. My mom who I loved so, so much just might leave my life forever, so I thought at the time. She always told me she was ""sick"" and that the heroin scattered amongst the house was medicine. Anyway, the police got to my apartment building, Im up on the third floor and I have to buzz them into the building. **I didn't know how.** So, there I was left with A gigantic decision. My mom was dying, do I stay with her with her for her last moments, or do I leave her, alone, in her vomit and blood, to get what might potentially save her life. After about 10 seconds, I put the phone down and I let them in, they rushed upstairs and when I got back she had stopped moving. I was certain she died. We called my grandma (me and a cop) to come pick me up and take me to her house. about 7 hours later I got a call from my mom, she was alive, and unwell. She told me how much she loved me, and how sorry she was, and she **PROMISED** she would make it up to me. I made the stupid decision to believe her. 1 month later she was back, ""healthy"" and out of rehab, but she was still using. Everything was back to normal, as my addict mom and my completely healthy dad battled in court for me, I was kept fully out of the loop, (which I now agree with) I was living back with my mom half the time, just me and her. Then after a month or so, I awoke on another school night. But this time it was different, things were breaking, alarms were ringing, smoke was pouring into my room, My house was on fire. I got up, left my room and looked into my kitchen, the whole thing was in flames, I was coughing up thick black smoke and couldnt see a thing. So, I did what I believed to be the best thing which was to go get my mom, I have to save my mom! right? I sprinted and swung her door open with my eyes watering, screaming, ""MOM! MOM PLEASE GET UP!"" repeatedly, only to soon realize she wasn't there. I looked in the bathroom, I looked in the living room, even back in the kitchen. I couldnt find her. So I left, I went downstairs and out the building where everyone else was. I was sobbing, telling everyone my mom burned up, because thats what I truly thought. And then out of no where, like a movie, she appeared in the crowd, and it clicked. She had left me in there, I could have died in there, I looked for so, so long for my mom, whilst the whole time she was actively leaving to burn and die, alone in my room with my cat sweetie. (R.I.P SWEETIE <3) I just couldnt believe it. When I told my dad, it was over, he made the executive decision to ignore the law. He did everything in his power to keep my from my mom under any circumstance. My apartment with mom was inhabitable, so she moved in with the same grandmother that had picked me up that one wednesday morning. And **SOMEHOW** because my dad was breaking the law bound agreement to allow my mother to see me half the time, the court was siding with my mother in what would become a 3 year long custody battle. This whole battle im resenting my father for not allowing me to see my mom after the fire, whilst also being so sad that she left me there to die. But I forgave her quickly as a 8-9 year old boy. This whole battle, my grandma had also been facing a battle that I didnt know about, She would go on to die of lung cancer about a year later, December 23rd 2015. I truly loved her so, so much. Now, due to her death, my mom had no home, she kept using heroin, and was in and out of jail for petty theft charges constantly. My dad had finally won custody over me. Life was sad, but finally I didnt have to deal with all this shit going down all the time. Until I did again, because my grandma was a wealthy woman, she had left me a sum of money on her will for the day I turned 18 years old, which would now be in exactly 1 month and 1 day, this sum was $65,000. But unfortunately, I would find out 2 years ago at the age of 15 that because this will was last updated before my mother would become an addict, she would have the authority to hold this money for me. Im sure you can see where this is going... My mom did not save that money, she used all of it, every penny on heroin and other pointless things that she currently no longer has. It makes me feel so utterly useless. Am I really **THAT** invaluable to my own mother who I loved unconditionally? My dad and I were fighting because he used to never tell me the whole story about my mom, and my man was, well, not being remotely a mom. So I was so, so sad, I was in grade 10, covid was hitting, I couldnt see my friends, My mom was gone, and had ran away with my future education fund, and everything was terrible. Now I am 17, living with the sadness to this day. Every minor inconvenience in my life is detrimental to my mental health. I feel like life is a constant loop of pain, so it isnt worth getting out of bed to experience, I just want to curl up in a ball and lay there in my bed, completely silent, alone. I began cutting myself a week ago. Ever since then it has been calling me. It literally feels as if the razor blade that is currently in eyeshot, speaks to me, tells me that it can help me feel something. My arm is currently riddled with dry blood from the cutting I did moments before deciding I was going to type out this post. (I never use reddit) and university is coming, I got accepted into the UFV which is the cheapest, closest school in British Columbia to me. But I just cant go to school, I used to be a fantastic, lively student with good grades, I now average a 46% only maintaining a 79% in English 12 because I NEED it to graduate, and my dad would be devastated if I didnt graduate and became a failure after all the work he has done to get me to where I am now. I think thats my biggest fear, to fail my father after all he is done for me. I think im done now, I am done typing. If no one reads this, well, atleast I wrote it all down to look back at. But for those who read the whole thing, please give me honest opinions or whatever in the comments, I want to hear what everyone has to say. thank you guys.

Ramblings of a man lost to himself,0,"I don't know who I am anymore as a person. The only time I feel like anything matters is when I'm at work and people don't judge me for the things I've done, things I've owed, things I did. Life seems to just flash me by in an instant and I just am skating through like I'm watching a movie and not truly in control of my actions. Everything that has led up to this point I feel is pointless. Nobody I know feels thing they know me, and I don't feel like I know myself. When I'm not sober I don't feel this way. I feel like I have some semblance of emotions and by that I mean drinking. I don't dare do that often for fear of becoming an alcoholic, I don't do any sorts of drugs at all and I haven't for years and I certainly don't intend to again other than the occasional hit of weed but even then I get paranoid because I know I shouldn't be doing it. So that has basically stopped. I've wanted to do so many things with my life and it all just falls apart. At one point, in high school, all I could've ever dreamed of doing was growing weed and smoking it all day long and being a vegetable who does nothing. At the end of the day in a way, right now at least, I feel like I'm nothing better than that place because I just kind of skate through things feeling unable to take control. Tonight I had an intervention of sorts that was for me about my handling of money and how poorly I've been doing so. I'm working on it and my aunt is helping me but that still dosent help fix my other issues. Right now as I write this I should be looking into and researching psychiatrists to go to. And I have known that I need to be doing this and yet I hav enot done it. How long you ask have I been needing to do this? Almost 2 weeks now because it always slips my mind until right before I'm supposed to go to bed and then I keep myself awake to do so but tonight instead of doing that I'm writing. On the outside I look calm and collected, I'm not, I have nothing under control at all. I was going to a therapist but I can never quite get out the things that matter and on top of that her schedule was very conflicting with the way I live my lifestyle since I never seem to get enough sleep, so on the days that I do I just kind of let things slip and I sleep for hours at a time over the normal amount. Once it was so bad I slept for 24 hours straight and then woke up in the morning time only to realize I was late for work. I hope I can find it in me to get to the psychiatrist because I'm not sure if it would help at all but it certainly seems it would. I just need help and I don't know how to find it properly or speak on the things that need to be spoken about for it to be effective. I can't communicate properly like there is a mental block when I get into deep nervous states about talking about serious things and this happens a lot if not every time. I used to write long speeches like this to my therapist about things that I had inside that I never spoke on in our sessions but honestly I never sent them. She would give me things to do in between the sessions and I would never do those things for this or that reason but I honestly don't know why. They would have definitely helped and they still probably could but I continue not to do them for some reason even knowing that it will help me. Circling back to I just feel like I'm skating, watching my life pass before my eyes, and not being able to do anything about it. I feel like to do these things what it might take is someone constantly being there to make me do it but then it would create a problem in my mind where I would no longer want to even if it helps because I feel like I'm being forced to do it. 

Sometimes I wonder if the drugs I did back while I was in highschool permanently changed my brain chemistry too much and that is causing the issues I have today, and then other days I wonder if it's because I didn't socialize enough as a young adult because of the passing of my mother and grandfather. And even other days just because of not wanting to be abandoned again? On that subject there is well more to tell. I push away everyone that is close to me whilst still keeping them at arms reach just enough to maybe still call them friends but at this point I don't feel like I have them as friends anymore, just people disappointed in me who only stay out of pity. And I've done all of this to myself just to avoid feeling the hurt of abandonment which I will inevitably feel anyway if they do actually leave. And yet I continue to push away the people that should be the closest to me in life without a second thought or worry about any consequences that may bring. I need help, my mind is screaming for it but I don't know if I'll ever be able to achieve actually getting it if I can't overcome this self loathing and fear of being judged",13s64x2,throwaway6635427,1685085360.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s64x2/ramblings_of_a_man_lost_to_himself/,,Depression
"Today I dreamed that I was going on an excursion with a girl I fell in love with a long time ago, and we were holding hands. I woke up and I want to die.",1,"I have gone from the best moment in my last months to one of the worst.

I dreamed of an old friend, of whom I was secretly very interested, and even in love, she came with me to spend the day in a kind of museum. The dream was like all dreams, weird. Without sense. 

But I only remember the moment that I meet my friend, and Igrabbed her arm and my hand and we began to walk. We were talking about something, something surely nonsense, because it was a dream.But I remember as if it were right now as in the dream, her hand caressing mine. We would sit and look at each other, without letting go, and she kept stroking my hand. With a feeling of affection.

I don't remember any more of the fucking dream. I've woken up. And when I realized where I was and what she had really been, and I started to cry. To kneel on the floor like a ball for 10 minutes, wondering why I've never been even remotely happy like this. Because I have never been able to feel a little affection from other people.

Hopefully the next time this happens I won't wake up. I have nothing in this garbage of a world worth my while.",13s5llw,Bayek3087,1685083486.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s5llw/today_i_dreamed_that_i_was_going_on_an_excursion/,,Depression
I'm 16 and I'm falling down the rabbit hole,1,"Hi

I'm a 16-year-old girl who was been struggling with depression for the last 3 years, last year was my first massive downfall tho I stopped going to school and stayed in bed all day never showering and thinking of ending my life just so I didn't have to see my family's pitty faces every time I came out my room then at the end of last year I got better I started seeing a psychologist, I started getting out every day. I still wasn't going to school but I was feeling better each and every day then at the start of this year I was put into a flexible learning school I only had to go 2 days a week for 2 hours each day but I couldn't do it and sadly the past 2 months I've felt myself fall back into the rabbit hole of depression I had a girlfriend and we broke up like a week ago, my hygiene is getting worse again, I've felt myself pushing the people that care away. And the past week or so I've been feeling suicidal, I don't want to think about ending it but I keep thinking about it. I tried so hard to get out of this hole last time so does that mean it'll be harder if I try again? will this happen again every year and will it just get harder each time? I don't think I have the strength to try this time I haven't told my psychologist or family as last time my parents weren't very helpful with supporting me and my psychologist wouldn't tell my parents better ways to support me. What did I do wrong to deserve this? Is this the universe's way of telling me my times up what do I do? Or am I just an entitled brat that is not grateful for the opportunities given to me (Words someone told me)",13s9dy7,Kind-Sea4446,1685096995.0,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s9dy7/im_16_and_im_falling_down_the_rabbit_hole/,,Depression

I don't want to die,2,"Music has a remarkable power to heal, inspire, and evoke emotions within us. It serves as a refuge during our darkest moments, helping us find solace and understanding. One such song that has such an affect on me is Monsters by James Blunt

A change in mindset allows us to uncover new layers of meaning within the song. Rather than dwelling on the negative emotions, we can explore the song’s lyrics for hidden messages of empowerment, resilience, or personal growth. What may have initially felt like a source of sadness or pain can be reframed as a reminder of our inner strength and the challenges we have overcome.

When we shift our mindset, we can use the once negatively perceived song as a catalyst for positive change in our lives. We can adopt the song as a personal anthem, allowing its energy and message to inspire us to take action, pursue our dreams, or overcome obstacles. By recontextualizing the song, we harness its potential to motivate us and drive us towards personal transformation

Monsters become my drunk song, I’d gravitate towards this after one too many beers, until that night where I wanted to end it. It stuck deep, it was personal, I felt James Blunt sing into my soul, his eyes fixed on mine, I felt he was singing to me. I was at my lowest, and all I had for company is Jame Blunt and a set of stairs.

Thankfully I still get to live and breathe, I dragged myself out of the dark hole, but still gave the song a wide birth, through my recovery I couldn’t listen to it, it held so many triggers, so many memories I wasn’t ready to listen, just thinking about it gave me shivers, and instantly put me back to that night. I held off listening to it. Until a month or so back, when mentally I was in a much better place, I’m 340 days sober now. I wanted my suicide song to be my recovery song. I wanted it a yard stick of how far I’ve come.

So I sat, and listened. And realised I’m not the same person I was on the 11th May. This song empowered me now, it showed how far I’ve come, how much I’ve achieved, how much I was living to die, instead of now I’m dying to lie, I have my zest for life back. I’ve amazing kids and and a beautiful girlfriend. This song and the lyrics don’t be afraid. It’s my turn to chase the monsters away.

Took a whole new meaning, the monsters in my head I chased away, the alcohol had been stopped, I’m now running, looking after my body, I want live to see my kids grow up, I want to educate and raise awareness. I want my story to be a survival guide.

I fell in love with life again.",13s9byb,grumpy_hubby,1685096832.0,3,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s9byb/i_dont_want_to_die/,,Depression

Does a job help with your depression?,1,"So I'm quite confused if having a job helps with your depression or whether it just adds more stress... Just for clarity, I am currently holding a stable job but I have mixed feelings on whether it helps...

Reasons why I think it doesn't help :
1) Although my job is low stress low pay, I would think that most jobs involve a certain amount of stress no? Wouldn't that cause someone with depression to break down further?

2) I'm like trading one problem for another. With a job comes taxes and the realization that I'll be doing this capitalist shit for the next 40 to 50 years of my life, it makes the depression worse lol

3) Constantly having to hide it in the workplace is tiring and the facade collapses when I reach home

Reasons why I think it helps :
1) I now have my own meager paycheck which i can use to buy stuff i like instead of leeching off my parents all the time.

i don't think i'd be happier with any other career path or future though. i can play an instrument, i can draw, ive won awards for both, but im utterly uninterested in doing those for a living, and making those my job would just ruin any joy i get from it. plus, my depression has made me unable to even focus on doing those anymore.

im pretty much stuck. my family are expecting, or even dependent, on me and my job prospects to take care of them in the future. and i can't think of anything i'd rather have, anyways. im so tired. i don't think i can make another year of this, where i have all the reason to be happy -- a providing family, a wonderful friend, hobbies, skills, scholarships and honors programs -- and yet i just can't care. ive tried meds, ive tried therapy. honestly, if i killed myself on the night of graduation, it'd be pretty poetic. but i don't think i can make myself do that either.",13s297r,tsyiqkns,1685072612.0,2,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s297r/graduated_with_honors_full_scholarship_great_job/,,Depression

Is my depression on this valid,0,"I have been super depressed about this issue for a couple months now and I can’t seem to figure out if my depression is valid. I can’t seem to figure out if it’s clinical depression or just an emotion. I’m already diagnosed with GAD and have been diagnosed with depression in the past. Lately I have really been hating myself and have been depressed because I let my anxious thoughts get to me. For those who are familiar with “Snapchat memories” this is a sort of cloud based photo and video storage that you save all your favorite snapchats to. I was really anxious that people were coming after me and tracking me so I became so paranoid to the point where I deleted a majority of these memories. Now I’m depressed because so many of my favorite ones are gone. I’ve been beating myself up over it for like 2 months now, which surely isn’t healthy. I just can’t get over the fact that I was so anxious and let my negative thoughts get to me, that I destroyed old memories that I found so valuable. I believe that I am truly depressed over this and my mental health diagnoses are actually linked to how I’m feeling. It sucks and I understand that people have real issues in the world, but this is literally something that makes me hate to be alive for some reason.",13rzj8e,FairRepresentative90,1685064588.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13rzj8e/is_my_depression_on_this_valid/,,Depression
Life just feels so fucking stale right now.,2,"I don’t know what exactly served as the trigger event, but it’s as if life’s colors have become so goddamn gray and dull, that I’m struggling to come up with a good enough reason to wake up every day and keep on pushing through. Life’s tough even when you have motivation, but it can be a fucking chore when you don’t even know why you continue going through the motions.

Maybe it was a number of factors compounding on each other - covid, wage cuts, health problems in the family. I used to be the kind of person who’d find solace in dodging all the shit that came my way with an optimistic outlook and a witty sense of humor. But that only helps until you start reaching a certain line. Right now, I feel plagued by the thought that the only reason I still carry on with life is because that’s supposedly the right thing to do, and there are people that would be deeply affected if I were gone.

I don’t want to admit that mine’s a hopeless case. Maybe I just need another POV to find new motivation, long-term. I’m not someone who finds it easy to open up to people I know, like friends or family. Even then, there’s no guarantee they’d provide the advice I need.

The only time I let my guard down was with a co-worker at a corporate event. We never spoke all that much, but she had something about her that made me wanna open up a bit about my anxiety, so I did. She was a good listener, but I didn’t pay two minds about it. Three days later, I get an email from her “Hey. It’s X. Please don’t think I’m intruding, but if you still need help with what you told me about at the party, you might want to call the [Mental Health Hotline - 866-903-3787](https://mentalhealthhotline.org/). I’ve been there myself, and it gets worse the more you stall. Hope this will help. Don’t give up.”

That thoughtful gesture from a semi-stranger was so unexpected, that for a sec, I felt like I was remembering why I wanted to keep fighting in the first place. While beyond grateful for the support, I still feel like I should try reaching out to the public at large, and Reddit was always a platform one could hope to find kindred spirits.",13s8qdn,nearspray867,1685094943.0,12,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s8qdn/life_just_feels_so_fucking_stale_right_now/,,Depression

This dream fucked with me,2,"I just had to mull over something after I had a wild dream.  wanted to share it with you guys. Please share your feelings if you'd like to.

 In the dream, my boyfriend was walking me to a room where I'd surrender my life under legal euthanasia. 

In waking life, I've been deeply suicidal these last 2 months. I've been hiding my plans/methods so that no one can stop me. 

Depression since adolescence and I'm nearly 26 with a lot of what I'm able to convince myself are ""good enough reasons"".

But now after that dream, I'm dumbfounded. In it, my boyfriend didn't stop me. He didn't say anything. I was sad that he didn't stop me. When we reached the final room, he just turned around and left. I stood there in the doorway staring back at him as he disappeared, to what I imagine, his new life. Probably sad for a bit but relieved of the burden. Probably swiftly find a better girlfriend. 

These are triggering thoughts. The truth is that our depression makes everything seem worse than it is. IRL I know he cares. Can't project my dream onto him. And I'm responsible for keeping myself alive.

I think it was a wakeup call. I depend on him too much. He takes care of a lot for me. Our relationship isn't great but he's kept me alive. If he decided to leave me one day, while I'm still not working, ashamed and anxious, barely able to get out of bed, that would be it for me. I'm going to have to become self sufficient and at least give myself the choice to continue living. 

My days are so down and then stable and then down again. I bury everything with alcohol and music and compartmentalizing.

"25M, Struggling to get over not making more of college experience",5,"Had social anxiety that I was in denial about in college and didn't make the most of my experience, didn't really make friends and didn't go out and party much. I got a good degree and things look good for me, good job, exercise, decently active social life, nice gf, planning on buying a house soon by myself etc. I hate working though and can't get over not making the most of college, seems like everyone hates their jobs but can atleast use their wild youth as a sort of nostalgia that sustains them, where as that option isn't available for me. I'm pretty much over my social anxiety now though and know that if I could go back in time but as I am now I would make friends and have loads of fun and I think that's what hurts the most, feel like such a loser. When my girlfriend talks about her college experiences I play along and pretend I had fun too because I think she'll lose attraction if she finds out I was mostly a loner. I don't think there's any way can recreate that youthful fun of being a pretty carefree 20 year old and just seems like I'm staring down the barrel of a boring life slowly getting older.

I wouldn't live with my family for a period of time because I got I trustee thoughts of what I injured or harmed a love one or a dog etc. I feel terrible.

Parents expectation makes me deppressed,0,"I have been living a very sheltered life my whole life, when i was still a kid, i remember not being allowed to play outside by my dad at all, even playing football in front of my house was a big no no(got scolded and mom got scolded too for that). when i first learned how to ride a bike, i was honestly super happy because i have a bit of freedom to go where i wanted even though its only in a small area near my house, but thats also a not allowed like a month after learning it, i was only allowed to ride in my block thats only like 60m x 4m so i quickly got bored of it. even in my middle school and highschool, i am not allowed to go out much and hang out with my school friends, so i just play video games inside my room all the time. never had problem with grades so they just let me be.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now 21 years old, i  have trouble speaking to strangers, keeping a relationship, and find it hard to start a conversation with my long time friends. My dad have a small to medium sized business and i am expected to inherit the business the sooner the better. I have tried to make it work, but i dont have the confidence being a business owner where relationship and networking is the major thing to have when running it. so these couple of month i just dont go there anymore with plenty of reason everyday. i know im just running away, i have talked to my dad about this and he said im just too stupid to realize that the life i have right now is super nice and easy.

&#x200B;

These past week i sometimes cry in my room for 30 minutes at a time, i have suicidal thoughts but i am too afraid to kill myself, i also dont want to talk about mental health issue with my parents as where im from, its not considered a thing at all, my dad is an old school tyrannical fathers that even when i talk to him, my views and points are always being looked down upon because i dont have life experience and just supposed to do what im told to have a succesful life.",13s61c2,Watachips,1685085006.0,4,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s61c2/parents_expectation_makes_me_deppressed/,,Depression
I just want life to stop throwing whammies at me.,0,"This year has been really rough for me so far. My family moved back in November of last year, I used to have a job back where we used to live, but I can't find one where we are at now yet because mom has to work to keep food on the table and we only have one car. I can't drive yet but we're going to start the process to get my license pretty soon if everything goes according to plan. I'm not used to a lot of the stuff that's been happening lately and it's been putting a lot of stress on my neurospicy brain. We've been having money issues and my mom is in debt from having to move. On top of all of this, it feels like everything I've been looking forward to is being postponed and it's making me panic. Additionally, my online friend group is dissolving slowly and painfully due largely to some drama I don't know all of the details about that they won't tell me much about and I'm starting to stress about having to find a new group. I am seeing a therapist, I just did yesterday, but the issues with my group are starting to escalate and I'm not sure when exactly I'll be able to see my therapist again. I see glimmers of hope, I just wish I wasn't so stressed and I wish issues would stop popping up seemingly all the time.

Edit: I also forgot to mention I'm having some health problems that I'll need to see a doctor about. Doctor visits give me horrible anxiety.",13s60ns,Meggolor,1685084941.0,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s60ns/i_just_want_life_to_stop_throwing_whammies_at_me/,,Depression
"I really need help, but I don’t know where to start or if I can ever get help.",1,"  

In the past year, my will, energy and motivation to keep going on has only been decreasing. At first I just accepted it and would try my best to push through my studies in university and through my part-time job. But now I cant even seem to get out of bed, not even for my classes. The only times I force myself to get out of bed is if attendance is required for a class or when I have to get to work. And despite laying around doing nothing and wasting my time away, I don’t even sleep much. I sleep on average 4 hours a day, cannot seem to stomach eating anymore, and I now do the bare minimum in terms of hygiene and self care. 

I never realized how bad it was until I just recently realized how I have lost track of time and its been two years since I graduated high school, and I cant remember much from the past two years. It upsets me that I am wasting my time, barely passing my class, and still have no idea what program I want to be in. I cannot take a break because my parents refuse to let me take a gap year, which I really needed to deal with my burnout from high school, and from everything in general, so now I am currently in open studies just so I don’t disappoint them. 

I have always grew up in a stressful household, in a household where the common form of communication seemed to yelling and insults, whether that was insults between my parents or toward my sibling and I. It use to happen 1-3 times a week, now its seems to happen multiple times a day. Most of the time when I’m at home is to either be the mediator between the fights, or my parents insulting me and calling me lazy and useless, even though I try to do as much as I can around the house such as cleaning, laundry and shopping, and helping my younger sibling with school. And I know its the bare minimum but they don’t seem understand how hard it is to even get up recently, and I get so exhausted after doing simple tasks such as cleaning my room. But my parents never tried to go easy on me whenever I would try to explain myself. They proceed to call me selfish because according to them all I do is stay in my room or selfishly put all my energy at work and choose not to do so at home. And even though I have repeatedly explained myself that this isn’t true, they chose to never listen to me. I feel hopeless because I have no one else to talk to, and when I finally broke down and tried to end it, my parents got mad of me and mocked me. But regardless, I love and adore my parents because they sacrificed so much for me, immigrated from our homeland for a better quality of life and education for my sibling and I, and work so much to provide for us. And despite their constant outbursts, anger and yelling, I cant get upset towards them because their behavior if also due to both of their parents being abusive. And I understand that this doesn’t justify their behavior but I still sympathize with them. 

I’ve tried to reach help from school services and actually went to a few therapy session via the university back in winter  but I did not feel like I could fully benefit from it because I could not bring myself to explain my situation in my household, and also because my parents got upset when I let it slip that I was attending sessions without letting them know.

I know how pathetic this all sounds, and I'm 19 turning 20 this year and all I do is waste my time away doing nothing and can’t get my life together. I don’t find any joy in life anymore, everything is dull and grey, I despise myself and can’t remember much anymore or what has happened in the past two years. I don’t even perform hobbies that use to keep me going such as painting and drawing, I don’t even remember the last time I sat down to draw. My mental state has only been getting worse, and I’ve resorted to self-harm to feel something. My mental state feels like its spiraling and it’ll only ever get worse from here. I feel like I’m suffocating and there is no way to escape. Everything feels so bitter. 

I apologize for the long post and rant, but I would really appreciate if I could get any sort of guidance and thank you for any help, I deeply appreciate it in advance.",13s5zuf,Mish-67,1685084857.0,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13s5zuf/i_really_need_help_but_i_dont_know_where_to_start/,,Depression

Some people on reddit said that my brother may have been right abandoning us. I might fail to see a perspective of him. Or maybe i can't understand him.

But I never though he would have the capacity to leave my younger siblings in a situation. I know he's 18 and he can do anything he wants. He might be justifies. Or maybe I'm very immature to see his decision he made. 

But the problem is my mom put him on a pedestal and I also trusted him.the fact he left us and stole the money me and my siblings collected is just bothering me.

It's been making me feel very ill this situation. even he's 18 I understand he's decision why is he ghosting me and not replying to a single message. Am I right to feel this way am I still immature that I can't see this. he went away with a gf btw

I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay.

"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act",209,"Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,163,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

Depression = Losing intelligence,193,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement.

I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,92,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up.

"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".",124,"But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded.

"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.",335,"Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,210,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

Being depressed and having depression are different.,161,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me.

I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,99,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,86,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

I identify with that...  so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",378,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",eczhm3,Absalom98,1576789860.0,2385,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eczhm3/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_couple_days_ago_my/,,Depression

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",177,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",doqwow,SQLwitch,1572360722.0,2367,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,,Depression

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive",143,"Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",g8eq07,Broad-Panda,1587909359.0,2350,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g8eq07/im_19_my_girlfriend_was_murdered_the_trial_is/,,Depression

I think my wife saved my life this morning.,85,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo...

Suicide ice cream,156,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

I’m killing myself [update],134,"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.",151,"I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident",104,"I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off.

Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,74,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear.

"I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold.",230,"I’ve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4:30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it’d just be easier to end it all. I’ve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. 

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn’t seem to help at all so I stopped going.

“Um, you can afford alcohol but you can’t afford therapy?” She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

Yes. I am a mess, lady. That’s why I called! I left the conversation feeling so much more shitty about myself.

&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted.

Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified.,118,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this?

I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,248,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries.

In the day time I have to do things and be productive. I have to see people and talk to them. I have to pretend I care about doing anything and I'm not thinking of suicide every five minutes. Nighttime is sort of like this void that is congruent with my state of mind. Nothing is happening. Everyone and everything is quiet. There are no expectations. It's like everything is finally over for a little while. It's just me and my thoughts and an emptiness that is finally acceptable.

It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past.

Edit (05/24/2020): I did read all the comments, thank you. This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be.

I'm just saying I've never been thankful that I didn't kill myself,204,"Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since.

I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance,116,"No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.",br6vgb,naturalwonderofthewo,1558419506.0,1888,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/br6vgb/i_wanted_to_kill_my_self_last_night_but_instead_i/,,Depression

I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,179,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do.,140,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,206,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more.

I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,131,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",e9uflv,,1576188302.0,1850,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9uflv/im_tired_of_being_everyones_therapist_when_no_one/,,Depression

Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,119,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach.

My sister saved my life yesterday.,85,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know.

Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,102,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole.

It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with.

I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. 

I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me

I'm not going to kill myself but everyday I feel like dying,112,"Every single day I feel like I want to die.

I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents.

My drive to achieve any goals has faded.

A part of me doesn't  want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

God please help me !

Thinking about taking the Zoloft that I was prescribed a few months ago. I have a doctors appointment in a couple weeks but I'm thinking about taking this Zoloft again.

Today was my 21st birthday,579,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent.

You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down.

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.",75,"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend.

I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself :)",69,"I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday.

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,82,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable.

I hate how people are automatically given the title attention whore if they don’t hide their depression well enough,84,"At least for me I’ve hated how people say something like “oh that person isn’t actually depressed, it’s just for attention.”

I don’t understand the whole complex between depression and attention but I do know nothing feels worse than being in a depressive episode and having nobody to talk to. 

Maybe it stems from that.

All I want is my best friend back.
For us to have real conversations again.

Too bad I have self sabotaging tendencies but that’s a story for another day.

I just don’t want to feel completely alone anymore.

I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,157,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected.",146,"I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.",133,"before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

Do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about?,129,"Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid. Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,200,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

"One of, if not the worst things about being depressed, for me, is that I have to force myself to do basic shit. I have to make an effort to maintain my body for example, or just get outta bed. Everything is labored and thought about beforehand. No enthusiasm even for hobbies. Force myself to do them",123,"So everything is labor in that way. I don't think people who don't have depression truly understand just how uphill it can seem. When everything has to be forced to be done or it just won't get done. It's exhausting and I'm already exhausted.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,143,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. ",dip94b,,1571232149.0,1647,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dip94b/im_fucking_sick_of_my_life_but_im_too_scared_to/,,Depression
I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,166,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships.",bmt4zr,Jamiddle,1557457481.0,1642,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bmt4zr/i_really_hate_when_people_invalidate_a_depression/,,Depression
My parents told me to kill myself,134,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either.

If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.,64,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. 

I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it.

Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...,153,"I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. 
My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss.

"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!",146,"Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group.

Regular Check-In Post,7161,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life.

"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?",131," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us.

I feel so guilty for having depression when I’ve not really had anything traumatic happen to me and there’s so much evil going on in the world,112,I don’t deserve this life,n4a5iz,_ChilledVibez,1620083482.0,1612,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n4a5iz/i_feel_so_guilty_for_having_depression_when_ive/,,Depression
My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP,119,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,109,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . 
You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health .",g2ojjp,prettyEDGELORD-69,1587073930.0,1609,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g2ojjp/my_dad_told_me_stop_being_depressed_because_its/,,Depression

I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,97,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again.

I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,169,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,132,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin",ive8e5,,1600461985.0,1593,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ive8e5/i_am_the_singer_of_a_pretty_well_known_band_and_i/,,Depression

25 years old with absolutely no friends,156,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,171,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.

I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.,108,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,191,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever.",e0r6a9,GangreneMachine,1574556799.0,1561,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e0r6a9/the_most_depressing_part_about_turning_30_is_when/,,Depression

My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,152,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel.

"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.",71,"So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,160,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

Casually Suicidal,127,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

I want to cry everyday. I want to die everyday. Everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die.

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length",150,"Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",kz4j2r,,1610881394.0,1501,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz4j2r/bought_a_gun_with_my_stimulus_for_suicide_posting/,,Depression

Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression.,104,"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens.

Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I?,109,"I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do.

I will never understand how people can live and be happy,119,"Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me.

“JuSt Go tO ThErApY”,227,"I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

I feel beyond suicidal,98,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

""theres so much to live for""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch.

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up.

"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?",79,"First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

I think my life is destined to end in suicide,106,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.


Edit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore.

Warning: Watch out for PMs pushing religion.,317,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".

I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time.

When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer,77,"When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do.

When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood?

When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy.

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time

11yr old son came to me and said he had planned to shoot himself.,81,"Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. 
   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !",rmiync,PlausibleDeniabilaT,1640219438.0,1376,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rmiync/11yr_old_son_came_to_me_and_said_he_had_planned/,,Depression

I hate feeling unwanted, feeling like I don’t belong, like I’m just another face in a crowd of people..

"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist",103,"My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",og9ont,Retexo,1625758539.0,1379,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/og9ont/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_i_just_dont_want_to/,,Depression
"I hate how ""Go to therapy"", and ""Start exercising"" are thrown around like they are a magic pill.",251,"Don't get me wrong many have benefited from this, but how many haven't?

It seems that for everyone these don't work they are followed with find a better therapist or working out will just release endorphins to make you feel better or some shit.

If only I had kept all the wasted money on therapy to pay 10 escorts instead, I'd be much better. Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.

To sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).

Oh and the workout part?

Instead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.

All this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,109,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

What's the point in asking for help if no one actually cares?,73,"I did everything right today. I gathered my thoughts. I talked to my best friend. And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

My mom died yesterday,163,"My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city.

I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity. Feels almost like an act of self-love.

"I'm a lazy, pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life, in debt, no degree, lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything.",350,"Title says it all. My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man.

I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. 

I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. 

I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

Edit: to everyone young reading this, just try to promise me you'll at least go to school and get a degree, not to impress anyone like most egomaniacs, but just so you have a good job and can get your own place and be proud of yourself.

I'll be 40 in six months and have wanted to die since I was 12.I failed at life and want to die more than ever.,136,"**EDIT:** I'm so sorry guys. I spent an hour responding to more comments, only to have to delete them because I was mistakenly posting from my main account.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

I miss the old me,71,"I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive.

I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,92,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.",l3y52m,ohnonceciestterrible,1611489412.0,1317,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l3y52m/i_think_acting_depressed_around_people_was_a/,,Depression

Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself,78,"January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.  I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,177,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,107,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

My parents thought I died in my room and were prepared to bust down my door,63,"One day, when my parents went away for the weekend and I drilled two deadbolt locks to my room.

Why? I have no privacy in this house. When my brother was angry at me that same vacation, he kicked down my door and threw a pail of kitchen garbage all over my room. The ""lock"" on my door is easy to unlock, apparently my parents are able to open it easily and have been snooping into my room when I'm not there.

The day before yesterday, I had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me; knocking over dishes and screaming that I ate so much. I locked myself in my room and didn't eat anything the whole day after that.

Today I wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back. I see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way; but the two deadbolts were there. That probably was a surprise to them.

I didn't want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door, so I opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door. There were so many things left unsaid, I wanted to yell at them for more reasons.

I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),134,"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win.

Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?,147,"I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

My dad is gone... forever,74,"This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",ibn6rc,QuickHouse5,1597699152.0,1260,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ibn6rc/my_dad_is_gone_forever/,,Depression

I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. 

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

I have lost my empathy.,106,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing.

My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.,161,"So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. 

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health.

"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself",105,"First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)

Depression steals your youth away,123,I remember when I was 15 and my depression started that was 1995 I hated school with a passion that was the first year I ever was on a antidepressant aka Prozac which didn't help at all. By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can.

"Turned my life around, depression didn't go away. What's the fucking point then?",198,"After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help. Tired of having to push myself to keep existing, when all I get in return is feeling sad and lonely. I'm tired of suddenly finding myself a few years older and realising I have no new happy memories.

I'm almost 28 and i have wasted my life,255,"In a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life. I have never had a job, a girlfriend, or a close friend. I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

Mom said I’m free to commit suic*de if I finished my study.,126,"I’ve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn’t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?

I have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don’t think anything will help me out.

My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2,167,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me.

I’m not depressed, I know a lot of people would miss me and I would destroy my parents if I actually tried to do anything. But none of this truly matters sometimes. I feel empty in a way I can’t put into words and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to this - lack of - feeling. I don’t want to actually pursue a career, I don’t feel motivated to do anything, I don’t see myself working as a teacher and actually being happy, but I also don’t see myself working with anything and being happy.
I just want it to stop. I don’t want to exist, to have to follow social rules, to be human. Sometimes I just feel like every action I make is forged and I’m just waking up everyday, putting on a mask or something and pretending I care about the world. I don’t. I think humans are as insignificant as ants, and that’s actually a beautiful thing. We’re bound to fulfill our duties, keep the engine working and then die.
I wish I could just unplug without hurting anyone, just vanish as if I’d never existed.

Came close once or twice.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.

my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,91,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.",88,"It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

"I need at least one person to see this.

I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that.

I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter.

How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,270,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working.

How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??,200,"One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. 

Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I'm lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. 

Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop.

"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.",71,"After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

43 and completely lost,206,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.

I’m kinda disgusted with myself,99,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.

The cancer has spread to my liver,78,"Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock.

Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,123,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. 

Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better”

Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore.

"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.",94,"Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

So I bought myself flowers today.,64,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.

Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,71,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them.

I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. 

My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. 

The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do.

i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,99,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

Annus Horribilus,49,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",g41t6v,neergnai,1587271837.0,1077,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g41t6v/annus_horribilus/,,Depression

my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore,108,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.,205,"Just like the title says I am 58 M.
I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.

Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,138,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion",480,"Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion.

I feel too sensitive to exist,164,"Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

I'm consciously wasting away my life.,101,Time doesn't have the same weight anymore. It flies by. I can see my life falling apart yet am unable to do anything about it. No drive to do anything. I'm either stuck in the past which is beyond repair or the uncertain future. Feel sleepy all the time. I know how much of an valuable asset time is but life just doesn't appeal to me at this point. Why is there so much noise in my head? A serene mind is all I wish for but it seems nigh impossible to achieve. So much mental struggle. Always overthinking about something irrelevant.

I can't kill myself until my cat dies,82,"For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day.

"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out",102,"I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of.

No one showed. I should have expected that.,170,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",73o2tr,TripleNoFriends,1506889674.0,1010,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/73o2tr/no_one_showed_i_should_have_expected_that/,,Depression

Everything hurts,63,"My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good.

I sold my guns.,67,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,153,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away.

"Ever feel like you've been depressed for so long, you can't imagine not being depressed?",130,I've been told have this or that personality trait but all I see in myself is emptiness.,12074jt,myplantsaidno,1679627106.0,900,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12074jt/ever_feel_like_youve_been_depressed_for_so_long/,,Depression
Some people just aren’t meant for this world,89,"This world wasn’t made for people like me. The way I think, feel, and act are so out of the norm that it feels like I’m not actually a person. I can’t act normally. My default is just anxious, quiet, and weird. I’m incredibly introverted yet I still desire to have friends and have a partner. These two things are fundamentally opposed to each other. One most likely can’t happen while the other one is still in place. Basic interaction with other people doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s easy to blame society as shallow and exclusionary, but at the end of the day, I can’t really blame them. I don’t really bring anything to the table and I don’t even know if I personally would want to be close with someone like me. I feel like my soul belongs to another world.",xwd1dg,Voidful-,1664982290.0,882,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xwd1dg/some_people_just_arent_meant_for_this_world/,,Depression
i'm so close to killing myself,181,"I'm so tired mentally and physically but no one seems to understand, i don't know how to show what i'm really feeling but everyday feels like i'm suffocating.
Everyone keeps telling me it will be better soon but i don't believe that, i'm tired and i've tried every way of help available to me but nothing helps.
I don't want to be put to some institution but i don't know what else to do anymore, i don't want to live everyday of my life waiting for it to get better and trying my hardest not to just lay in bed all the time.
I'm only 17 and i feel hopeless and tired, no one really understands how i actually feel, it feels like my head is being held under water or something everyday.
I don't know what to do, i need help but i've tried like everything i've been told to by doctors and stuff, i know it doesn't happen overnight but i've been struggling with depression since i was 13 and it only has gotten worse.

Edit: I wanted to thank everyone for kind and sweet words, your stories and suggestions of how to make myself feel better is very appreciated.
You guys have given me hope that i can continue even if it gets hard sometimes, now i know there are people that care and i'm not alone.
I have decided to continue and try my best to get better<3",vvoh6u,jokiisdumb,1657448065.0,886,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vvoh6u/im_so_close_to_killing_myself/,,Depression

Sudden sadness after socializing,79,"I visited with a friend for a few hours, it was fine, nothing bad happened, we chatted and ate lunch at a restaurant.

I just can't fucking cope with life,141,"How the fuck do people keep going to work every day? How am I supposed to keep doing this? I'm literally just working part time at a coffee shop but I feel as though I am in agony every day. It's all meaningless and worthless, we literally work a job so we can afford to live another day to work our job. I can't even begin to comprehend how anyone is happy. My family work so much more than I do, and I can tell they're stressed out, but they push through. I just can't wrap my mind around it. Fuck. Just fuck it all. I fucking hate being alive in this world

I appreciate all the replies, I don't really have it in me to respond individually, so I'll just say here, thanks for the good wishes and for sharing your own struggles.

"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",287,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",11vys6c,circinia,1679262278.0,70,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11vys6c/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,,Depression

I wonder what it's like to be normal,41,"To not overthink about every single interaction you've had

To not stress over the smallest things in life

To not be afraid of showing who you really are

To not dread every single interaction with family and friends

To be able to have a normal conversation without it fizzling out so quickly

To be able to express yourself and your emotions without fear

To be able to say what you like and what you want without being judged

To be able to show what you love

To be able to maintain stable relationships with other people

To be able to connect with others

To be able to live with freedom and to not be imprisoned by your past
